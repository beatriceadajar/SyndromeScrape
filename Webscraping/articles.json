                "Fast forward to today: The allies of President Rodrigo R. Duterte in the House of Representatives recently endorsed an impeachment complaint against another chief justice. She, too, the complainant averred, did not enroll the true and complete details of multimillion pesos in fees she received as a co-counsel in the government's case against a multinational contractor, before she was appointed top jurist in August 2012.",

                "What to redact, why?",

The SALNs provided were invariably outstanding for the details they blacked out, than for the details that they revealed, or must reveal, according to guidelines of the Civil Service Commission (CSC).",
                "It is not clear whether some or all of the redactions on these SALNs were made on request of the filers -- the Cabinet members -- or on decision of the personnel of MRO, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), and Office of the President who have been designated as \"data privacy officers\" of their agencies. The latter -- supposedly called \"the Clearinghouse of the OP Family\" -- made the actual redactions. ",
                "They supposedly want to protect the \"right to security and privacy\" of the Cabinet members, citing as basis the Data Privacy Act or Republic Act No. 10173. But then they seem impervious to the fact that the redactions are clear violations -- even an act of \"repeal by implication\" -- of The SALN Law or Republic Act No. 6713, which upholds and the principles of transparency and accountability in public service.",
                "PCOO Assistant Secretary Kris Ablan told PCIJ though that some secretaries, including his boss, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, had expressed concern that certain data in the SALN could invite malefactors to harass the filers or their family members.",
                "Right to security, privacy?",
                "Multiple redactions had been made in fact on the SALNs that Malacañang released to journalists last August 16. Days earlier on Aug. 4, Ablan wrote Chairman Raymund E. Liboro of the National Privacy Commission requesting \"clarification on the disclosure of information in relation to the sworn (SALN) of government officials.\"",
                "In it, Ablan said that he was writing on behalf of the PCOO, the Office of the President, the Office of the Cabinet Secretary, and the Presidential Management Staff. Altogether, these agencies make up what Ablan told the PCIJ is called \"the Clearinghouse of the OP Family.\"",

                "PCIJ registered its opposition to the redactions made on the SALNs of the Cabinet members with NPC's Liboro and with Ablan -- whose team of three persons had diligently monitored implementation of President Duterte's Executive Order No. 2 that instituted a Freedom of Information policy in the Executive Branch.",
                "Three meetings with PCIJ, the NPC and the OP Family Clearinghouse officers and lawyers held in recent weeks revealed, among others, that the latter seemed oblivious to the fact that it is not the Data Privacy Act (Republic Act No. 10173) that should apply in the situation.",
                "Instead, it is Republic Act No. 6713, the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, or by shorthand, The SALN Law, that should be the reference in the filing of SALNs.",
                "Too, the meetings clarified that it is not the National Privacy Commission but the Civil Service Commission that is the chief enforcer of guidelines on the proper filing of SALNs, and of the constitutional and statutory provisions on public disclosure.",
                "Deal-breaker for FOI EO",
                "On advise of lawyers, and from interviews with CSC and the Office of the Ombudsman, PCIJ informed Ablan and the NPC that the redactions made might have resulted in \"defacing\" public documents on multiple counts, and constituted a \"repeal by implication\" of the SALN law. ",
                "Because they mock the authenticity of the FOI EO that the Duterte administration had issued in July 2016, PCIJ told the NPC and the OP Family Clearinghouse that the redactions are a clear deal-breaker for the CSOs that had been engaged in pushing the bounds of the FOI executive order.",
                "To be sure, if only the OP Family Clearinghouse had checked out the relevant laws, the redactions should not have been made in the first place.",

                "Under circulars it issued in 2011, 2013, and 2016 on the filing of SALNs, the CSC had prescribed more than explicitly that the SALN \"should state true and complete declaration of assets, liabilities and net worth, including disclosure of business interests and financial connections of the declarant.\"",
                "In 2013 the CSC said that while the declarant shall provide information on his/her address, \"whenever a third party request for a copy of the SALN...the agency has the option to shade the declarant's address for purposes of security.\" In short, there is only a conditional authority from CSC for repository agencies to redact just one and only one information in the SALN -- the filer's address. ",
                "The 2011 guidelines of the CSC spelled out that:",
                "•    \"On ASSETS. Assets including those within or outside of the Philippines, whether real or personal, should be declared as well as description of real properties as to the kind, nature, exact location, acquisition mode and year, assessed value, fair market value, acquisition cost of land and/or building, including improvements made.",

                "It must be noted though that the last two provisions cited here from the 2011 CSC guidelines were later removed by CSC Memorandum Circular No. 5, series of 2012/Resolution No. 1200480, after several government agencies raised concerns about the 2011 SALN format.",
                "In 2015, the CSC again instituted a new SALN form. This was followed by the 2016 guidelines that, apart from requiring its use across all agencies, further clarified that:",

                "The Office of the Ombudsman, meanwhile, had even launched last year the pilot run of its e-SALN project, which would usher in the electronic filing of SALNs with over a million public officials and employees as targeted filers. ",
                "The SALN template has been coded under the e-SALN project, and its full rollout is expected to take a few more years. The matter of digital signature, and minor tweaks to the coded template are now being addressed. ",
                "Recently, Deputy Ombudsman Cyril Ramos, project head, had stressed in a public presentation that the filing of \"true and detailed\" SALNs by all public officials and employees upholds the principles of transparency and accountability in public service.",

                "First massive redaction",
                "By the reckoning of both the Ombudsman and the CSC, this is the first time that multiple redactions on the SALNs of Cabinet members had been made. The SALNs of Duterte, the senators, and officers of the constitutional commissions, and civil servants across the board do not bear any redactions, except in some cases, and only involving the home address of the declarant, as CSC has so allowed.",
                "Says a lawyer from the Office of the Ombudsman: \"Redaction gives you no protection at all. It may even trigger suspicion you are hiding something.\" The lawyer does not recall any case of an official exposed to security problems on account of the SALNs, even as he cited the value of these documents for pursuing cases of corruption and unexplained wealth.",
                "Redacting SALNs, if deliberate, \"may constitute tampering of public documents,\" says the Ombudsman lawyer, and if done on orders of higher officials, the latter could be culpable, too. The lawyer notes that the Data Privacy Act has not expressly or explicitly repealed the SALN law, and thus, \"repeal by implication or redaction cannot be allowed.\"",
                "CSC: SALN law stays",
                "CSC Assistant Commissioner Ariel G. Ronquillo, who heads the Technical Working Group on the SALN Law -- composed of representatives of the Office of the President, the Ombudsman, and other SALN repository agencies -- says that the CSC guidelines must prevail as the reference in the filing of SALNs.",
                "Interviewed by PCIJ, Ronquillo says that he finds no discrepancy or dissonance between provisions of R.A. No. 6713 (SALN Law) and R.A. No. 10173 (Data Privacy Act).",
                "\"I don't think at this point we have to determine which one will prevail,” Ronquillo says, “because in any instances where there is an apparent inconsistency, just an apparent inconsistency between two laws or between two issuances, the first order of the day is to find a way to reconcile these inconsistencies. In other words, to find that situation where those inconsistencies will not be there. We have to interpret these two laws in a way that they will be harmonized. \"",
                "But, he adds, \"I have made a brief reading of the law as well as the implementing rules and then I made a review of our own guidelines, and honestly based on my reading, I didn't see any inconsistency. Yeah, so those two laws can go hand in hand. So when it comes to SALN, I think we have to apply the guidelines on the SALN. When it comes to other matters that are clearly within the coverage of the Data Privacy Act then they can apply those regulations issued by the Privacy Commission. I think that's how to approach it.\"",
                "Under the Data Privacy Act, he notes that an exception of coverage has been specified for \"any individual who is or was an officer or employee of a government institution that relates to the functions or position of the individual.\"",
                "PDS another matter",
                "Ronquillo makes a distinction, however, between the SALN and personal data sheets or PDS.",
                "\"If the matter is purely private to the person whether he is in government or not it may still come under the scope,” Ronquillo says. “For example, personal data sheets (that) are required for any government official or employee upon entry to the government.\"",
                "He notes that the PDS \"strictly contains personal information\" and \"before you can access the personal data sheet of a government official or employee, you have to seek the consent of the person.\"",
                "But that is not the case with the SALN, says Ronquillo. According to the CSC official, privacy may apply to PDS \"but not with respect to the SALN.\"",
                "\"Our stand with respect to the SALN is that it is an instrument of transparency and therefore it should be available to the public upon request,\" he adds.",
                "In Ronquillo's view, The SALN Law and the CSC should prevail as the reference law and mandated agency in regard to the SALN matters. ",
                "CSC has mandate",
                "Says Ronquillo: \"Kami’ yung may mandate under (R.A. No.) 6713 to issue the guidelines. So kapag sinabi naming na available iyan for public scrutiny, they cannot, even if they rule otherwise, they cannot prevail. Dapat kami masusunod. (We have mandate under RA 6713 to issue the guidelines. So when we say that should be available for public scrutiny, even if they rule otherwise, they cannot prevail. Our orders must be followed.)\" ",
                "By all indications though, the OP Family Clearinghouse might have crossed over to prohibited territory when it redacted multiple data fields in the SALNs of the Cabinet members.",
                "Ronquillo says blackening out the home address of the filer is all that the CSC guidelines allow, nothing more, nothing less. \"Yung pag-cross out ng mga material information in the SALN such as the statement of properties as well as the different amounts involved, 'yun nga ang dapat ipakita (that is what should be disclosed),” he says. “So I don't think it is covered by the Data Privacy Act because the SALN is an instrument of transparency. If you will not disclose that to the public that will defeat the very purpose why people in government are required to fill out SALNs.\"",
                "\"Without necessarily ruling on whether the action is correct or not,\" Ronquillo says, \"our guidelines actually require the statement of the exact place of the property that is reflected in the SALN and that is necessary again for purposes of transparency. If the public looks at any government official's or employee's SALN, and the public should also be given information as to where those properties can be found for purposes of verification.\"",
                "Transparency is the spirit that should drive the filing of SALNs, he says. ",
                "Unwanted effects",
                "\"Through the SALN,\" according to Ronquillo, \"we are actually telling the public I am not hiding anything; I am not enriching myself at the expense of the government. So if you want to inspect my properties, go ahead and inspect. And just to prove to you that everything is legitimately acquired, then go ahead and inspect all those properties wherever they are from. That's why even those information should be open to the public or whoever requests the SALN of that particular government official or employee.\"",
                "Redacting or hiding some data about a filer's properties may even trigger unwanted results for the filer, he says. ",
                "Ronquillo agrees that public officials \"should be allowed to protect themselves from harassment and from all other dangers” but also notes that, “there is no assurance that by hiding those information, the protection sought will be achieved. I think that is not the proper way of protecting themselves from harm.\"",
                "\"That act of hiding those information can even give an impression that they are hiding something from the public that will give the public more reason to do deeper investigation about the accumulation of their wealth and that will generate more interest about them,\" he says. ",
                "\"The moment you hide them, it would really give an impression that you are hiding something and that the acquisition or the accumulation of wealth was not that legitimate that you do not want the public to look at it. So I think that would be contrary first to the principle of transparency and to the very reason why we are executing SALNs.\"",
                "A good SALN discloses",
                "\"In other words,\" according to Ronquillo, \"a good SALN discloses everything; a good SALN does not hide properties that belong to the filer.\"",
                "PCIJ has asked the CSC Commissioners en banc for an official advisory on the guidelines that should apply to the filing of SALNs. In reply, on Sept. 14, 2017, Ronquillo stated: \"On the matter of shading or redaction of information in the SALN,\" CSC Memorandum Circular No. 2, s. 2013, allows agencies to shade one and only one data: the address of the declarant \"for purposes of security.\"",
                "The CSC is presently reviewing its policy guidelines on the SALN, he added. \"Rest assured that your concerns will be considered, specifically the matter on redaction/shading of information in the SALN when a copy thereof is requested, and on the mater of the effects of the Data Privacy Act of 2012.\"",
                "But after three meetings with the PCIJ, the NPC and the OP Family Clearinghouse have agreed to reduce to a minimum the redactions they want to make on the SALNs, notably the declarant's address, names of children of minor age, government ID number, and signature. When the Palace finally released the SALNs requested by PCIJ last week, parts of the exact location of the filer's real assets were also redacted.",
                "PCIJ has asked that the redaction process be made transparent, and that a written explanation be issued by the OP Family Clearinghouse stating why and on what basis such redactions would be made. ",
                "However, the cover letter for SALNs released to PCIJ this month only briefly explained that the redactions made “pertain to personal information covered by Republic Act No. 10173, otherwise known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012.”",
                "And because additional redactions apart from the filer's home address would be a clear stretch of what the CSC guidelines allow, PCIJ said that it would be good for the OP Family Clearinghouse to realize that they are by implication repealing or amending the SALN law at whim. ",
                "Some results",
                "The meetings with PCIJ have clarified a few points only. For one, the NPC and the PCOO have now included the CSC and the Ombudsman in the discussions on the redactions being made. The NPC has decided to hold off on issuing the advisory requested by PCOO, until after full consultations with other agencies and stakeholders. Too, the NPC and the PCOO have agreed to call a meeting on Sept. 25 of the SALN repository agencies to align practices in compliance with the law.",
                "Apart from the CSC, the Ombudsman, the Office of the President, the Supreme Court (en banc and Office of the Court Administrator), the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, and the Office of the Secretary-General of the House of Representatives are also SALN repositories or custodian agencies.",
                "In a way, the situation boils down to which should be the greater concern or obligation of public officials: privacy or transparency?\n \nThen again, the expectation of privacy, once one enters public service, seems unwarranted at the very least.",
                "'Right to security'",
                "When PCIJ asked Ablan for the first time last August about the redactions, he said: \"Informal rules were outlined by the Clearinghouse of the OP family. News reports about the relatives of Secretary Martin Andanar triggered it.\" ",
                "\"We are just looking after our principal,” Ablan said. “Under FOI, there is fear that the information disclosed might lead to harassment and identity theft.\"",
                "To see what kind of news reports may have been the cause of concern for Andanar, PCIJ checked out media stories and photos about his relatives. But it found just a few featuring his wife, Alelee Aguilar Andanar, a daughter of Las Pinas Mayor Imelda 'Mel' Tobias Aguilar and former Mayor Vergel 'Nene' Aguilar.",
                "In any case, Ablan told PCIJ that the Clearinghouse composed of assistant secretaries -- who serve as \"data privacy officers\" but often also as the FOI receiving officers of their agencies -- had set \"an unwritten rule that it is okay to redact names of children, address, plate number (of vehicles), the signature on and the number of government-issued IDs.\" ",
                "Privacy, not secrecy?",
                "\"We are not trying to hide anything,” Ablan insisted. The concern of committee is we have to protect privacy of our principals.\"",
                "\"Our unwritten policy also is we will wait for request for reconsideration from requestor, and if needed, we can unredact,” he said. “I hope you understand where we are coming from.\"",
                "The MRO chief, lawyer Concepcion Zeny E. Ferrolino-Enad, was, according to Ablan, \"willing to disclose but there has to be a middle ground because there could be irresponsible people who will use the info in the SALNs.\" Asked if the redactions on the SALNs of the Cabinet members imply special protection for senior officials of the Duterte administration, Ablan replied, \"The plan is, even the SALNs of the rank-and-file, we will redact.\"",
                "He said that there is \"no policy yet from the National Privacy Commission but we have asked for comment. If they tell us we cannot redact, we have to find proper authorities or forum to clarify. I hope you understand our concern is to protect people from harassment.\" This much he assured PCIJ: \"We can call for an emergency meeting for you with the Clearinghouse.\" ",
                "Spooked by Privacy Act",
                "PCIJ had also interviewed Liboro prior to the meetings held between PCIJ and the NPC and OP Family Clearinghouse.",
                "PCIJ told Liboro that data privacy officers at the Palace seem to have been spooked by the huge penalties that could be imposed on them for \"breach\" of the Data Privacy Act, but also seem unaware that they may be violating The SALN Law by redacting or withholding information they are obliged to disclose under transparency and accountability laws.",
                "Liboro sounded reassuring at one point, saying, \"The Data Privacy Law does not protect government officials, agencies, contractors or companies. It does not proscribe other laws.\"",
                "But, of course, he said there is \"a difficult balancing that must be made between data privacy and FOI.\"",
                "\"Data privacy separates government data,” he said. “Hindi kampi sa gobyerno ito, kaya mahirap gamitin para sa gobyerno (It’s not on the side of the government, so it’s hard to use it for the government).”",
                "It's a constitutional duty",
                "By contrast, the CSC's Ronquillo is crystal on the matter: The SALN Law must prevail in regard to the SALN. ",
                "Remarks Ronquillo: \"This is a constitutional duty so all of us are doing this on a yearly basis and so therefore we also have to be prepared when someone looks at our SALN and someone scrutinizes it. If we are sincere in all our obligations as government people, we should not worry with what is reflected in our SALN. Otherwise, if you do not want that kind of practice, then you have to leave government.”",
                "“You have to leave government,” he repeats. “This is part and parcel of being with government.\" -- With additional research by John Reiner Antiquerra and Vino Lucero, PCIJ, September 2017"

                "He said Duterte’s public statements may have empowered some law enforcers to violate the law since the President has assured them of his support as long as their actions are done in the performance of their duties.",

                "“This is a global indictment of the kind of justice being perpetuated in the country. Getting this… reputation is no surprise because this government promotes impunity as an official policy,” Baguilat said.",

                "Cornejo had accused Navarro of raping her on January 17 and January 22, the night of a controversial mauling incident that left the \"It's Showtime\" host seriously injured. ",
                "In a review resolution dated 6 September 2017, the DOJ reversed its original recommendation to indict Navarro on the said offenses and held that both Cornejo and her stories were not credible.",
                "The evidence presented by Cornejo's camp did not establish probable cause to indict Navarro for the crime he was accused of committing, said the DOJ.",
                "The department said it scrutinized the records of the case, but \"such thorough scrutiny has failed to make us engender a well-founded belief that the rape and attempted rape described by complainant actually happened.\"",
                "The DOJ conducted 3 investigations in connection with the case, but the charges against Navarro were dismissed in the first two investigations and Cornejo was indicted for perjury in the third.",
                "In its review resolution, the DOJ said Cornejo “suffers from a very serious credibility issue,” as the department pointed out “major inconsistencies” in her three complaint-affidavits against Navarro.",
                "“[Cornejo’s] story about the incident on January 17, 2014 changed from no rape (or anything amorous for that matter) happening (first complaint-affdavit), to rape being committed by force (second complaint affidavit), and finally to rape being committed rendering her dizzy and weak due to a date rape drug-laced wine (third complaint-affidavit).\"",
                "“On the other hand, complainant’s story about the incident on January 22, 2014 started from rape being committed by force (first complaint-affidavit), to absolutely having no mention about any incident (second complaint-affidavit), until the events morphed into a mere attempt to rape her (second complaint-affidavit),” the resolution read.",
                "The DOJ also stressed Cornejo’s first complaint-affidavit contained less details than her second complaint-affidavit while “[c]ommon human experience dictates that a narration given close to the incident usually contains more details than one that is given later.”",
                "“This is because in the former, the events or details are still fresh in the narrator’s mind, while the passage of time will make a person forget details,” the resolution read.",

                "The resolution also mentioned the CCTV footage obtained from Cornejo’s condominium which showed her entering the elevator on the night of January 22, 2014 “only a minute” after Navarro stepped out of the elevator to proceed to her unit.",
                "“In that time span, [Cornejo] claims that respondent was able to push her towards the living area of the condominium unit and pressed his entire weight against her, before her friends arrived and immediately restrained [Navarro].",

                "The DOJ also noted that another CCTV footage, recorded after Cornejo and her friends brought Navarro to a police station, showed “[C]ornejo’s actuations after the supposed rape incident… are inconsistent with the actuations and demeanor of a person who has just been violated.”",
                "“Also, how come Cedric Lee was kissing complainant in the elevator after they had brought respondent to the police station?” the resolution pointed out.",

                "Castillo, 22, died due to massive injuries consistent with hazing, according to an autopsy report.",

                "Apart from police probe, the Senate is also set to launch an investigation into the incident on Monday as Castillo's death revived calls for stronger legislation against violent initiation rites. "

                "A police official confirmed Friday there were lapses in the anti-drug raid that saw police \"assets\" stealing more than P30,000 in valuables and cash from a businesswoman's house in Caloocan.",
                "Speaking to ANC's Early Edition, Caloocan police chief Sr. Supt. Jemar Modequillo said police officers involved in the September 7 raid have been relieved and placed under restrictive custody in Bicutan. ",
                "CCTV footage of the alleged anti-drug operation saw a disabled police asset, later identified as Mark Andrada Dizon, wielding a firearm while leading several police officers into a house that was allegedly used as a drug den. ",
                "Another alleged asset, a minor, could be seen stuffing cellphones and watches in his pockets while one police officer signaled to him to keep quiet. ",
                "\"I saw lapses. May na-overlook lang things that they are supposed to do...\" Modequillo said. ",
                "The police chief said the police team leader failed to directly supervise his men and even allowed one police asset to wield firearms. ",
                "\"We don't need the one there yung pilay (Dizon) na they authorized to bring firearms. That is actually a violation of the procedures,\" he said. ",
                "Asked if what happened can be attributed to lapses or \"just plain robbery\", he said: \"That is actually lapses because what is really needed is close supervision of the one handling those assets. The police commander or the team leader. He should have full control of the ones coming in.\" ",
                "He particularly cited the police officer who put a finger on his lips so that the asset who was stealing cell phones will keep quiet. ",
                "\"He knows what those assets are doing. Talagang masabi natin na may mga pagpayag sa mga ginagawa ng assets na iyon,\" he said. ",

                "\"As far as I heard, I learned from the police involved in the operation that that particular youth has that knowledge with regard to that particular individual who [was] pinpointed...allegedly as the source of the illegal drugs that has been confiscated from yung nahuli nila prior to that operation,\" he said. ",
                "\"Dapat may search warrant, 'yan ang legal . Pero kung time-constrained pwede ka mag follow-up talaga dahil continuing crime.\"",
                "Homeowner \"Lorena\", however, told ABS-CBN's TV Patrol earlier that the alleged drug suspect alyas \"Bebe\" had never been to her house. ",
                "Modequillo said police officers conducting the raid should have brought barangay officials with them during the operation to avoid rumors that the search was done illegally. ",
                "He said police should always do \"intelligence-driven\" operations, and not just base their information from tipsters who might not be telling the truth. ",
                "\"Hindi naman tayo pu-pwedeng basta magturo na lang. We cannot just allow things to happen. Try to put [yourself] in the shoes of these people,\" he said. ",

They are Police Officers Ariel Furlo, Jaypee Talay, Jay-R Sabangan, Jaime Natividad, Francis Ruiz Quidic, Jay Gabata, Michael Miguel, Marvin Poblite, Rene Llanto, Louie Serrano, Joey Leaban, Ronelio Julaton, and Sherwin Rivera. Also sacked were Senior Inspector Warren Peralta and PCP station 4 commander Chief Inspector Timothy Aniway Jr. ",
                "Aniway earlier said there was no spot report of the September 7 police operation because the officers involved did not inform him about the raid. ",
                "\"Hindi nila pinaalam na may pinasok silang bahay, sir,\" he told NCRPO chief Oscar Albayalde. ",
                "In the interview, Modequillo welcomed the plan of the Philippine National Police to reassign Davao cops to Caloocan after around 1,000 policemen were relieved from their duties last week.",
                "Lahat ng pinaplano ng ating higher-ups are all good ideas,\" he said.",
                "\"Kahit saan manggaling ang tao , kung wala yung close supervision to the elements level, talagang maliligaw at maliligaw yan,\" he added. "

                "His remains currently lie in state at the Loyola Memorial Chapels in Makati City. Interment details will be announced later.",
                "Malabed suffered a stroke in 2011, according to an interview by Agence France-Presse.",
                "He was thrust in the spotlight in 2016 following the controversial burial of Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.",
                "Malabed revealed that a wax mask covered Marcos' face for the 23 years his corpse was on show, but the body on display was no fake.",
                "\"The face the people saw was wax. But for the rest of the body there was no need for that because it was clothed,\" Malabed told told AFP. \"The hair, that's only a wig.\"",
                "In 1987, a year after Ferdinand Marcos was toppled and sent to exile in Hawaii, Malabed set up his own business that offered luxury U.S.-made bronze caskets and personalized mortuary services.",
                "Business really kicked off when Marcos died in exile 1989 and the family wanted his body preserved for an eventual return to the Philippines.",
                "Malabed shuttled between Manila and Honolulu every month to take care of the body until 1993, when the Philippine government finally allowed it to be flown to the dictator’s northern Philippine hometown of Batac.",
                "He said Marcos, who died from lung, kidney and liver complications aged 72, was disfigured by edema -- the build-up of fluid that causes tissues to become swollen.",
                "Embalming drains blood and other body fluid, which is replaced with preservative solution. But the resulting \"shriveled skin did not look good,\" the mortician said.",
                "Malabed said he received the already embalmed body a week after Marcos's death, but had to repeat the procedure because the face looked \"bloated\" and he feared it would decompose within a week.",
                "In 1991, Malabed said the widow paid another mortician to work on the face with materials \"similar to\" the restorative wax used to rebuild the faces of people disfigured in fatal accidents.",
                "Malabed said he last checked the corpse \"by hand\" on August 8, 2016 pronouncing it in good condition as burial preparations began in secret. He said another mortuary handled the actual ceremony.",
                "'Beautiful even in death'",
                "As a child, Malabed dreamed of becoming an engineer, but he soon followed in the footsteps of his mortician father.",
                "By the time he was an 18-year-old apprentice, Malabed was working on the mangled bodies of US soldiers killed in the Vietnam War, which had been flown to the then-US air base at Clark.",

                "But it has not been all Marcos: he also embalmed Aquino, the Marcos family's arch-political foe whose assassination at Manila airport by government forces in 1983 altered the course of Philippine history.",
                "Under strict instructions from the family matriarch, Malabed preserved the body, but made no effort to fix the bullet-shattered face.",
                "Aquino's corpse -- wearing the same bloodstained jacket in which he had died -- became the rallying point for the revolution that ultimately brought his widow to power, and sent Marcos into exile.",
                "For Malabed, a devout Catholic, the identity of a person when they were alive is not important; he treated all his clients equally.",
                "His skills did not come cheap, he admitted, but said the final result was well worth it.",
                "\"I make people beautiful even in death.\"",

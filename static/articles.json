In the case of CLTI, no request for extension was made within the original 15-day period to justify a belated filing of an import entry.”",

                "“Open pit mining, if done responsibly and rehabilitated properly, can and should still be allowed,” said COMP executive director Ronald Recidoro, in response to former Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Gina Lopez that open-pit mining may be cheap, but it does not give companies the right to damage the environment.",
                "“It’s (open-pit mining) the cheapest way and because it’s the cheapest way, does that give you the right to violate our constitutional right because it’s the cheapest way to do it? Why is your right to mine more important to our right to water and life?” said Lopez in a public affairs program recently.",
                "COMP chairman Gerard Brimo, also president of Nickel Asia Corporation (NAC), however, said that Lopez’s point of view “is totally wrong because if she were correct, there would be no open-pit mining anywhere in the world.”",
                "“The fact is there are tried and tested ways of rehabilitating open pits as has been done all over the world,” he stressed.",
                "Lawyer Francis Ballesteros of Philex Mining, for his part, said that it has been proven globally that an open-pit mine can be rehabilitated.",
                "“Do Filipinos really suffer when mining companies earn more? When companies earn more, they pay more revenue, because that is required by law. When companies earn more, government share is also more. That means more money to spend for the Filipino people,” he said.",

                "Snow leopards had been listed as endangered since 1972.",
                "The reclassification announced Thursday by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, followed a three-year assessment that determined there are not fewer than 2,500 mature snow leopards in the wild, and that their numbers are not in steep decline — the two criteria for being considered “endangered.”",
                "Using improved methods for assessing the cats’ population, experts estimated there are at least about 4,000 in the wild, though there could be as many as 10,000.",
                "Scientists have managed to survey only a small fraction of the animal’s high-mountain range, an area covering some 1.8 million square kilometers (695,000 square miles) crossing into 12 countries in Asia.\nDoing the research “is difficult,” said Peter Zahler, coordinator of the snow leopard program at the Willdife Conservation Society, who was involved in the multi-agency team’s assessment. “It involves an enormous amount of work in some of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the world.”",
                "New technologies, including camera traps and satellite collaring, are “giving us better information about where snow leopards are and how far they range,” he said.",
                "Some positive developments included an increase in the number of protected areas, as well as stepped-up efforts by local communities to protect the animals from poachers.",
                "Communities were also working to prevent cases of local herdsmen retaliating for lost livestock by building predator-proof livestock corrals, team member Rodney Jackson of the Snow Leopard Conservancy group said in a statement.",
                "Still, the animals are hunted for their thick fur and bones. They also face declining numbers of wild prey, as domestic livestock have degraded grasslands.",

                "Washington — With four big hurricanes, a powerful earthquake and wildfires, it seems that nature recently has just gone nuts.",
                "Some of these disasters, like Friday’s earthquake in Mexico, are natural. Others may end up having a mix of natural and man-made ingredients after scientists examine them. We also always tend to look for patterns and order in chaos, even when they aren’t there, psychologists say.",
                "“Nature’s gone crazy,” mused Jeff Masters, meteorology director at the private service Weather Underground. “Welcome to the future. Extreme weather like this is going to be occurring simultaneously more often because of global warming.”",

                "Hurricane Harvey hadn’t even fizzled and Houston hadn’t even dried out from record flooding before Hurricane Irma formed and also grew into a powerful Category 4 storm. Right behind Irma, Jose has powered up to a Category 4 storm. It is highly unusual, but not unprecedented to have back-to-back storms of that strength, Masters said. And then there is Hurricane Katia, just a shade under major hurricane status, due to hit Mexico’s Gulf coast.",
                "The last couple of years were quiet for Atlantic hurricanes, which makes this year seem even worse, said Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert. He said calculations that measure strength and duration show the three current Atlantic storms set a one-day record for energy on Friday. In just three days, Irma, Jose and Katia have produced as much as energy as about half a normal six-month hurricane season.",
                "Earthquake",
                "As Mexico was bracing for Katia off the Gulf coast, one of the strongest earthquakes in the country’s history hit late Thursday off its Pacific coast, near the Guatemala border. The magnitude 8.1 earthquake was felt for more than 650 miles (1,000 kilometers). The quake shook at a depth of 43 miles (69 kilometers) and a quake hitting at that depth with that strength is unusual, according to Cornell University geophysics professor Geoff Abers. It was one of the five largest for that deep in the past 40 years, he said.",
                "Wildfires",
                "On Friday, 82 wildfires were burning in the United States involving nearly 1.5 million acres in nine states in the West. So far this year, more than 8 million acres have burned, only behind 2015 and 2012. One fire at the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon has burned more than 175,000 acres and is only 5 percent contained as of Friday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.",
                "Drought and a heat wave contributed. On Sept. 1, in normally temperate San Francisco, the temperature hit 106 degrees and at least six deaths were reported from the heat wave.",
                "What’s Going On Here?",
                "Sometimes there’s a pattern in chaos. Sometimes there isn’t. Looking for patterns gives us a sense of control, even if we don’t really have it, said Scott Lilienfeld, a psychology professor at Emory University in Atlanta. “The human mind is a pattern-seeking organ,’” he said. “That’s how our minds work.”",
                "It can take weeks or months for scientists to determine whether an extreme weather event was worsened by man-made climate change. But scientists have long predicted that the strongest hurricanes will get stronger and wetter, fueled by warmer ocean water. And some say the recent global increase in powerful hurricanes fits perfectly with global warming.",
                "While warming may play a small role, so does Twitter and Facebook in making things appear worse, said Klotzbach.",
                "“It just feels like, you know, it’s the apocalyptic end times,” he said. “But a lot of this stuff is getting attention because of social media.”",

                "Since first hitting shore near Corpus Christi, Texas, more than a week ago, the storm dumped 27 trillion gallons of rain on Texas and Louisiana — enough to cover all of Manhattan a mile (1.6 kilometers) deep. It set a record for rainfall from a tropical system in the continental US, dropping 51.88 inches (1.3 meters) just outside Houston. That’s only an eighth of an inch (3.2 millimeters) behind the US record set in Hawaii in 1950.",

                "The deluge damaged an estimated 156,000 dwellings, and parts of Houston may be flooded for another month. The death toll of 44 ranks it as the mainland’s sixth deadliest hurricane in 50 years.",
                "What made it so bad? Harvey was strange — in how it nearly dissolved once but roared back as a major hurricane, in how it intensified so quickly before hitting land, in how it parked itself over one unfortunate region for so long and, of course, in the amount of rain it generated.",
                "“It had several unique characteristics in terms of its strength and track. And unfortunately they combined to produce a severe impact over a highly populated area,” National Hurricane Center Acting Director Ed Rappaport said.",
                "Harvey was born in the Atlantic southeast of Puerto Rico on Aug. 17, then got downgraded to a tropical wave and breezed into Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula with little fanfare. But once Harvey got into the Gulf of Mexico on Aug. 23, it rapidly exploded into a Category 4 hurricane just a few hours before coming ashore, something experts had not seen happen much before.",
                "It was the first Category 4 storm to make landfall in the United States since 2004. Rappaport and others said it will likely rank among the costliest storms to hit the United States. In some ways, it landed in the perfect place to wreak the most havoc. The worst of its rains stayed to the east of its eye and hit very close to the nation’s fourth-largest city, a city that is as flat as a tabletop and especially prone to flooding.",
                "That’s what Harvey will be remembered for, even though coastal cities like Rockport were all but flattened, said University of Miami senior hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. “They’re going to take backstage to Houston.”",
                "Most hurricanes, including 2005’s Katrina, weaken just before they hit shore. Harvey got much stronger, fueled in part by pockets of extra warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.",
                "“Harvey was the first to go from tropical storm strength to major hurricane strength in its last 36 hours before US landfall,” Rappaport said.",
                "Then it just stuck around.",
                "For more than 130 hours — from 10 a.m. Friday, Aug. 25, through 10 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 30 — Harvey was raining over some part of eastern Texas. When Harvey did move, including a dip back into the Gulf of Mexico for about a day, it was still close enough to drench Texas.",
                "“It’s extremely rare to have a major hurricane that just sits there after it makes landfall,” McNoldy said.",

                "Ildefonso stressed the urgent need for anaerobic digester investments stems from the increasing volume of waste, as well as the government crackdown on illegal dumpsites and the permanent closure of the Payatas sanitary landfill where Quezon City had been dumping its trash.",

                "The volume of waste Metro Manila LGUs dispose of daily varies from 487 cubic meters in Las Piñas to 3,507.7 cubic meters in Caloocan, according to the EMB data.",
                "“LGUs can reduce the volume of waste for disposal by turning biodegradables into organic fertilizer and biofuel through anaerobic digestion using proper facilities,” said Ildefonso, noting that locally available basic anaerobic digesters cost about P1 million each.",

                "The main problem why solid waste management is not progressing as planned under RA9003 is LGUs do not want to part in getting involved in garbage collection! This is where the money is today and is easy to control (from money collection point of view!) thus resulting to the present mess of our solid waste management system. Money is not an issue and an example is Quezon City! The most ideal set-up for Metro Manila is have a common solid waste management system.  That is one or two contractor collecting the garbage, delivering it to one or two material recovery facilities which can segregate, recycle and recover some of the materials. What goes to the sanitary landfill will be minimize and the biodegradable or organics can be composted as mentioned in the article and the rest recycled. This will not only address MM solid waste problem but this will reduce cost, modernize the system, make the collection safe, sanitary and efficient, have right garbage collection trucks designed for garbage collection, reduce traffic, MINIMIZE CORRUPTION etc. This is not only applicable to Metro Manila but this is true with small municipalities. One of our project never gets pushed through as the governor cannot get several of the municipalities under him to work together to make the project viable i.e. economy of scale. Financing is not an issue as this is readily available if you have a viable project proposal."

                "MANILA - The dean of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Faculty of Civil Law, who is a member of the fraternity involved in the hazing death of Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III, should also be investigated, according to a lawyer assisting the student's family.",
                "Speaking to ANC, Atty. Lorna Kapunan said Dean Nilo Divina, who earlier claimed he has been an inactive fratman of the Aegis Jvris, was the one who recruited the 22-year-old UST student to the fraternity, according to the account of the mother.",
                "\"She did not want her child to belong to a fraternity but they were assured by the dean that there was going to be no hazing,\" said Kapunan, who co-founded the Inang Naulila sa Anak (INA) Foundation.",
                "In the interview, Kapunan cast doubt on claims that Castillo was the only person undergoing hazing by fratmen.",
                "The lawyer also said the Department of Justice should verify reports that the fratmen involved in the fatal hazing of Atio, in panic, went to Divina's house after the hazing to seek help.",
                "Even if untrue, she said Divina, as UST law dean, should have ensured that the requirements of the Anti-Hazing Law were met and that there were at least school representatives when the initiation rites for the Aegis Jvris neophytes were conducted.",
                "\"If there were two responsible adults there I don't think the murder would happen,\" Kapunan said.",
                "Divina, however, denied that Aegis Jvris members went to his house after the hazing. He said he will file charges against Kapunan.",
                "Divina earlier said he has been inactive with Aegis Jvris since he assumed deanship. He also stressed that the UST Faculty of Civil Law does not tolerate violence among fraternities, claiming that Aegis Juris did not give them notice about the initiation rites.",
                "Kapunan, meanwhile, said it would be a good idea to turn primary suspect John Paul Solano into a state witness. She believes Solano is telling the truth, after he named names in the hazing incident during a Senate executive session.",
                "She hopes that the truth comes out especially they already received reports that Atio was not the lone neophyte in the initiation rites, and the 18 others were told to be silent about the hazing incident.",
                "FORUM SHOPPING",
                "In the interview, Kapunan also denied that she is \"forum shopping\" after the House justice committee junked an impeachment complaint against Comelec Chairman Andres Bautista for being insufficient in forum.",
                "Kapunan is an adviser of Mrs. Patricia Bautista, estranged wife of the Comelec chief. Mrs. Bautista earlier said she has documents that show the poll chief had P1 billion in unexplained wealth. She said her husband allegedly received \"commissions\" from Divina's law firm, which counts among its clients Smartmatic, Comelec's contractor in the automated elections.",
                "Divina has denied Mrs. Bautista's claims.",
                "Kapunan noted the impeachment complaint against the Comelec chief was filed without Mrs. Bautista's participation and before the National Bureau of Investigation could finish its own probe on the unexplained wealth.",
                "\"Patricia was not the one who filed the impeachment complaint. It was filed notwithstanding our advice to wait for the NBI report,\" she said."

                "US and Philippine forces have staged an exercise simulating the seizure of an American plane by Islamic State and a hostage rescue, as they look to refocus their military alliance towards counter-terrorism.",
                "The five-day training exercise which ended Tuesday was the first of its kind and saw more than 400 troops, airport police and hostage negotiators create a mock hijack of a plane by an IS cell that forced it to land at Clark airport north of Manila, officials said.",
                "Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the drill was in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's wish to refocus the two countries' 1951 mutual defense pact towards counter-terrorism and disaster relief.",
                "Since coming to power, Duterte has sought to weaken ties with the country's former colonial ruler and pivot towards China and Russia. He previously said military exercises with America were a \"humiliation\" for the Philippines and threatened to sever defense ties completely. ",
                "He has since banned the Filipino military from conducting joint patrols with the US navy outside Philippine waters and trimmed the number of joint military exercises.",
                "The latest drill was held in the shadow of a US-backed military campaign to retake the Philippines' southern city of Marawi, which was occupied by pro-IS gunmen more than four months ago.",
                "\"(It) served as a perfect opportunity to assess the needs of the new security environment in the Pacific region, especially now that terrorism has become evident in our current security landscape,\" Lorenzana said.",
                "Both governments stressed there was no such known plot against aircraft by IS or its supporters.",
                "The last hijacking in the Philippines was in May 2000, when a passenger armed with a grenade and handgun tried in vain to force a Manila-bound Philippine Airlines flight to return to the southern city of Davao."

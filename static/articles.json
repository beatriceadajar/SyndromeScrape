            "content": "MANILA - Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is eyeing a “better looking” millennial to help him carry out the critical task of speaking on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Roque, 51, said he wants a deputy spokesperson younger than him to convey the President's message to younger Filipinos.  He said he has picked for the job his former student at the University of the Philippines College of Law who is currently preparing for the bar examinations. He has yet to tell his chosen one but he is confident that he could persuade him to accept the offer. “I want a millennial. Number two, I want someone better-looking... than me so that the women will fall in love with him. And I want someone who speaks better than me. I promise the women, you will like the person I have in mind,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “There’s always someone who should be able to give the Palace position on different issues, and I think I’m choosing this person because I want a link between a 72-year-old President and the millennials of today. You will not be disappointed with my choice.” Roque said he needs a deputy since he wants to do some of his work in war-torn Marawi City, where government is setting a rehabilitation program after its liberation from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. The city, once a bustling commercial and cultural capital, was ravaged by five months of firefights between state forces and Maute terrorists.  “It’s an innovation that I thought of because the rebuilding is soon to begin and I think the people should know exactly what’s happening on the ground,” he said. “That’s why it’s going to be very difficult for me to be flying to Marawi every Tuesday evening. It’s a very long drive from Cagayan de Oro. It’s very complicated for security reasons and logistic reasons but I want to do that because I want to bring Malacañang to areas where, you know, attention should be devoted.” Roque, meanwhile, said he has no immediate plans of reorganizing the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “I’m not going to reinvent the wheel ‘no dahil naririyan na ‘yung karamihan sa kanila. I’m sure they can stay. And I will repeat what I have said: No one will lose their jobs because it’s Christmas. If there will be individuals that will be let go, we will wait until after Christmas and as I said, I would want to take advantage of the experience of people who are already here,” he said. “But please understand that as a Cabinet post, I also need to bring in people whom I can completely trust. And that’s the only reason why I’m bringing in new personalities.”",

Itinuturong salarin ang dalawang hardinero ng biktima na edad 15 at 17. Nakuhanan pa sila ng CCTV noong araw na sinasabing nangyari ang krimen. “May nakakita sa kanila [mga suspek], may kinausap sila na mga kasama din nilang minor… Tinapon ‘yong mga cellphone na ninakaw, sinubukan nilang bumalik sa crime scene. Gustong balikan pa ‘yong flat [screen] TV,” ayon kay Chief Insp. Aris Gonzales ng Angeles City Police Station 4. Hindi naman makapaniwala ang ama ng isa sa mga suspek na kayang magnakaw at pumatay ng kaniyang anak.  Desidido ang pamilya ng biktima na papanagutin ang mga menor de edad sa kasong robbery with homicide. Sa ngayon, nasa kustodiya ng City Social Welfare and Development (CSWD) Office ang dalawang suspek.  Magsasagawa rin ng assessment ang CSWD sa dalawang menor de edad para makapagbigay ng rekomendasyon sa piskal.-- Ulat ni Gracie Rutao, ABS-CBN News",

            "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 08:52 PM",
            "content": "Umaaray at mababa na umano ang morale ng mga empleyado ng Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) sa pagsuspinde ng kanilang mga \"unauthorized\" allowances matapos sitahin ng Commission on Audit (COA).  Sa panayam ng DZMM, ikinuwento ni PCSO Chairman Jose Jorge Corpuz ang daing ng kaniyang mga staff dahil sa natapyasang take-home pay. \"Malaki po ang effect sa mga empleyado, na-low morale po sila...Example yung aking staff in my office, [one of them] about P12,000 per month ang nawala sa kaniya. Ang take home [pay] niya na lang naging P600,\" pagbabahagi ni Corpuz.  Ayon kasi sa annual audit report ng COA para sa 2016, aabot ng halos P518.3 milyon ng hindi awtorisadong benepisyo ang tinanggap ng mga empleyado ng PCSO. Ilan sa mga ito ay napunta sa Christmas bonus, 14th at 15 month pay, educational assistance, grocery allowance, at iba pang klaseng benepisyo. Pero depensa ni Corpuz, ang mga nasabing bonus ay nakagawian na simula pa noong mga nakaraang administrasyon dahil parte umano ito ng mga compensation package ng mga empleyado.  Aniya, taon-taon naman daw naglalabas ng notice of disallowance ang COA laban sa kanilang ahensiya ngunit nasosolusyunan daw ito sa pamamagitan ng \"post-facto approval\" ng nakaupong Pangulo.  \"For the past years, binigyan po yan ng approval ng mga previous administrations,\" paliwanag ni Corpuz. Subalit ito'y nagbago nang maupo si Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte, na makailang ulit sinabing dapat nang itigil ang nagsisilakihang allowances ng mga empleyado ng gobyerno.  Agosto nila natanggap ang pasabi ng Office of the President (OP) na hindi inaprubahan ang kanilang \"post-facto\" request kaya't Setyembre pa lang ay suspendido na ang mga benepisyo ng mga tauhan ng PCSO. \"This present administration gave us a straightforward answer na they disapproved. 'Dinisapprove' po ng OP yung request,\" ani Corpuz. Hinaing ni Corpuz, ang mga nasabing \"perks\" ay \"all accounted for\" o kayang ipaliwanag.  Dagdag nito, ang mga benepisyo ay isa lamang hakbang para makasabay ang mga taga-PCSO sa antas ng pasahod sa ibang kumpanya.  \"Kasi naman 'yung GOCCs (government-owned and controlled corporations), hindi po kami kasali sa salary [increases] since 1989, nu'ng lumabas po 'yung salary standardization...so habang nag-i-increase 'yung ibang kumpanya, 'yung PCSO naman, ito lang ang compensation package namin which is very low,\" saad ni Corpuz.  Paniguro ni Corpuz, hahanapan nila ng lunas ang hinaing ng mga taga-PCSO. \"So now we're finding solutions how to compensate, to soften the impact on our personnel,\" ani Corpuz. ",

The Philippines joined southeast Asian countries Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand in the Chinese-led drill, the largest joint maritime rescue exercise yet held in waters off the Chinese port city of Zhanjiang on Oct. 31. Among the participants, Brunei also has partial claims to the waters. Notably absent in the drill were other South China Sea claimants Vietnam and Malaysia.  The drill was sponsored by the Ministry of Transport of China and joined by search and rescue agencies of ASEAN countries, according to a report posted on the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's official website.  The report cited how maritime cooperation is necessary as ships from the ASEAN navigate the South China Sea, quoting Zhuang Zeping, deputy director of the Guangdong Maritime Search and Rescue Center and the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration.  “...[T]he goal of the drill is to explore ways of increasing the success rate of maritime search and rescue as much as possible based on the human life-first concept,” said Zhuang.  The Chinese defense ministry said the drill is a joint action between China and ASEAN to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and improve cooperation in search and rescue drills. The exercise, involving around 1,000 rescuers, 20 ships and 3 helicopters, were participated by the PH, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Brunei. pic.twitter.com/XB09p36gnG  The exercise, held ahead of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in the Philippines this month, involved around 1,000 rescuers, 20 ships and 3 helicopters. The sea dispute is expected to be discussed at the summit, where ASEAN dialogue partners, including major powers China and the United States, are expected to participate.  At the ASEAN meeting in Manila in April, the regional bloc issued a statement that called for compliance with international law but was silent on continuing Chinese incursions in the disputed waters.  China has consistently asserted its expansive claims over nearly all of South China Sea, ignoring a July 2016 United Nations arbitration ruling on a Philippine case that invalidated its nine-dash line claim. ",

Sa kuha ng CCTV sa Asuncion Street sa Tondo, Maynila, makikitang sumakay sa isang sports utility vehicle (SUV) ang dalawa sa apat na lalaki.  Inaatras ng mga ito ang sasakyan habang inaalalayan ng kasamahan. Kalauna'y dumating ang isang motor na minamaneho ni Robel Intal, isang barangay kagawad. May sinabi si Intal sa nagmamaneho ng SUV bago umalis. Paliwanag ni Intal, binalaan lamang niya ang mga nasa SUV na mahihirapan sila sa pag-atras ng sasakyan dahil sa trapiko. Binaba nang husto ng driver ng SUV ang bintana sabay arangkada para habulin ang kagawad. Dahil sa trapiko, bumaba na lamang siya ng sasakyan. Nakihabol din ang mga kasamahan nitong mula sa ibang sasakyan. Iniwan nila sa gitna ng kalsada ang dalawang sasakyan. Sa kuha ng isa pang CCTV, makikitang walang kaalam-alam si Intal na hinahabol na siya ng apat na lalaki. Nang maabutan, kinompronta si Intal at tinutukan ng baril ng lalaking nagmamaneho ng SUV. Bukod sa pagtutok ng baril, pinababa rin si Intal sa motor at sinaktan ng mga lalaki. Matapos ang insidente, nagsumbong si Intal sa mga pulis. Kinilala ng mga pulis ang lalaking nagmamaneho ng SUV at nanutok ng baril bilang si Neil Tristan Gutierrez Boma. Pinuntahan ng ABS-CBN News ang sinasabing bahay ni Boma para humingi ng panayam pero wala umano siya roon. Ayon kay Intal, pinuntahan siya ni Boma para humingi ng dispensa pero sinampahan pa rin niya ng kasong grave threat, physical injuries, at usurpation of authority ang mga lalaki. -- Ulat ni Zyann Ambrosio, ABS-CBN News",

            "content": "MANILA – Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday admitted that his predecessor Ernesto Abella is a tough act to follow. Roque, known for being vocal on issues he is passionate about, told reporters he may find it hard to be as “calm” as Abella, a pastor. “He is a good friend of mine. You know that we belong to the same church. He is one of our pastors. I think he did a brilliant job as spokesperson,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “I don’t think I can ever be as a calm as [Undersecretary] Abella. And that’s why he’s a very difficult act to follow. I have asked for his prayers and I will pray for him. But I’m sure there is something in store for [Undersecretary] Abella.” President Rodrigo Duterte last week announced he has chosen media-savvy Roque as his new spokesperson. He, however, has not revealed why he chose to replace mild-mannered Abella. Reports, however, said Duterte was unhappy about Abella's handling of media queries on the double-digit drop in his net satisfaction and net trust ratings in the latest Social Weather Stations survey. Roque has said he and Duterte would surely be an “explosive” tandem, adding he might not curse like the President but that he would likely scream. He also promised to follow the President’s top order not to lie to the public.  “I realized that my working relationship with the media, having defended many of you for libel and having prosecuted cases involving members of the media, should help me in this new undertaking,” he said. “I assume this obligation cognizant of the importance of the free marketplace of ideas and I assume this obligation recognizing that the people do have a right to information on matters that affect them,\" he said. ",

            "content": "MANILA - The Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin its hearings into a criminal complaint against a woman allegedly engaged in the recruitment, through social media, of foreign fighters to augment Maute fighters in the Marawi City siege. Karen Aizha Hamidon, 36 years old, is facing 14 counts of violation of Article 138 (inciting a rebellion or insurrection) of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Republic Act (RA) No. 10175, also known as the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. She was arrested by operatives of the National Bureau of Investigation-Counter Terrorism Division at her residence in Taguig City on October 11, the same day she posted on social media another call for local and foreign Muslims to help Maute fighters in Marawi City. Hamidon is reportedly the wife of Mohammad Jaafar Maguid aka “Tokboy” and “Abu Sharifa,” who formerly led the group allegedly responsible for the September 2016 night market blast in Davao City, which calls itself Ansarul Khalifa Philippines (AKP), also known as the “MaguidGroup.” Maguid was killed in January 2017 by government forces in Sarangani province. The Philippine government has named AKP as one of “four ISIS-linked local rebel groups,” with operations in “different parts of Mindanao,” along with the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) from Basilan; Maute Group from Lanao del Sur; and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) based in the Liguasan Marsh, Maguindanao. “These groups have formed an alliance for the purpose of establishing a wilayah, or Islamic province, in Mindanao,” the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) told the Supreme Court (SC) in June, during the pendency of petitions challenging President Duterte’s declaration of martial law and suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao. Hamidon is also being linked to Australian Islamist preacher Musa Cerantonio, and reportedly also former wife to Singaporean national Muhammad Shamin Mohammed Sidek, who was detained for his links with ISIS.

            "content": "MANILA – Incoming Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said there is no reason to doubt President Rodrigo Duterte's statements, stressing that the Chief Executive would not make claims without factual bases. Roque said this when asked to comment on Duterte’s oft-repeated claim that the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is out to remove him from office or even kill him, an allegation that US Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim and a White House official have denied. “Well, if that is true, we’re happy,” Roque said of the statements from the two US officials. “But if the President says that there is, I have no position to dispute what the President says. The President has access to information that he only has access to. I have not seen it. But I trust and believe that my President will not say anything without factual basis. I stand by whatever my President says,” said Roque.  Critics have called out the President for supposedly making incorrect claims in his speeches, including his estimate that there could be 4 million \"drug users\" in the Philippines.  The Dangerous Drugs Board's (DDB) count was at 1.8 million. In May, Duterte fired DDB chairman Benjamin Reyes for supposedly contradicting his estimate. The President has also given various figures on the number of policemen supposedly involved in the illegal drug trade. In an interview on state-run PTV4 aired on Sept. 29, Duterte claimed there were 17,000 cops “involved in drugs.” But in a speech in Balangiga, Eastern Samar on Sept. 28, he claimed that at least 9,000 cops were involved in the illegal drug trade. Administration critics have accused Duterte’s supporters, including his appointees, of allegedly spreading fake news that seem to demonize members of the opposition and mislead the public.",

            "content": "MANILA - The Philippines on Thursday called for stronger international cooperation in the fight against terrorism following the recent attack in New York. Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano in a statement said the incident, which left 8 people dead and at least 11 others injured, shows that the threat of terrorism \"remains real.\" \"The terrorist attacks in New York and other places abroad during the past several weeks tell us the threat remains real,\" Cayetano said in a statement. Eight people were killed and numerous others were wounded in New York on Tuesday when a man rammed a pickup truck onto pedestrians and collided with a school bus in Lower Manhattan in what US authorities called an \"act of terror.\" The suspect is an Uzbek immigrant who reportedly left a note saying he carried out the attack in the name of the militant Islamic State group. The Islamic State recently made its presence felt in the Philippines, when its followers from the Maute terror group laid siege on Marawi City, triggering the worst urban conflict the country has seen since World War 2.  The crisis left more than 1,100 dead, most of them terrorists, and displaced the city's more than 200,000 residents and thousands more from nearby towns. Government last week announced the end of hostilities in the city after five months of firefights.  Cayetano said the fight against terrorism is a key priority of President Rodrigo Duterte and is among issues to be discussed among world leaders at the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Manila later this month. \"The Philippines is more than ready to do its share in helping make the world a safer place,\" Cayetano said, as he rallied the international community to intensify its efforts in going after the Islamic State and its affiliate organizations around the world. He added that Manila is looking forward to cooperating with other countries, particularly in intelligence sharing and capacity-building, as part of the country's counter-terrorism efforts.",

            "content": "MANILA – Malacañang on Thursday assured the public that no government fund was wasted in the construction of a mega drug rehabilitation facility in Nueva Ecija.  This was in response to Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) chairman Dionisio Santiago's earlier statement that the construction of the 10,000-capacity rehabilitation center was \"impractical\" and a \"mistake.” Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Philippine government spent nothing in building the facility as it was donated by Chinese tycoons led by self-made billionaire Huang Rulun. “Wala pong pera ng gobyerno na ginastos diyan sa mega rehab centers na itinayo ‘no. ‘Yan po ay ibinigay ng isang philanthropist na Tsino ‘no,” Roque said in his first press conference in Malacañang. “So bagamat ganiyan po ang opinion ng pinuno ng Dangerous Drugs Board, eh ang assurance naman po natin, walang nasayang na pondo ng gobyerno. That was a decision made by the donor and we can’t do anything about it.” The rehabilitation facility was seen to help drug users and pushers who had surrendered under the government's anti-drug campaign, but only 311 have been admitted in its first phase as of June this year. Santiago, former head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, said admitting drug dependents to the treatment center must have been difficult because of its distance. \"Saan mo panggagalingan 'yun? Yung iba taga-Batangas. Eh sa rehab, kailangan mo ng family support. Paano ka pupunta dun kung pamasahe lang sa loved ones mo, wala ka?\" he said.",

            "content": "MANILA- Nearly half of Filipinos think that the killing of innocent people is inevitable \"to completely eradicate the illegal drug problem in the country,\" results of a Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed. The Sept. 23 to 27 poll of 1,500 adults showed that 46 percent of Filipinos believe the killing of those who have nothing to do with the drug trade could not be completely avoided in the fight against illegal drugs. Some 35 percent disagreed while 19 percent were undecided, resulting in a \"moderately strong\" net agreement score of +10. The number of people who believe collateral damage is unavoidable in the drug war is highest in the Visayas, which has a \"moderately strong\" +21 score, followed by Metro Manila at a \"moderately strong\" +18, Balance Luzon at a \"neutral\" +9, and Mindanao at a \"neutral\" +1. The SWS said survey results showed that net satisfaction scores of the government's campaign against illegal drugs (good +56) and of President Rodrigo Duterte (good +44) tend to be lower among those who disagree that innocent casualties cannot be avoided in the drug war, compared to those who agree (excellent +70 and very good +52, respectively) and were undecided (very good +59 and very good +53, respectively). Nearly half of Filipinos (49 percent) meanwhile think that the government has used people to secretly observe and report those involved in the use and selling of illegal drugs. Some 19 percent disagreed while 31 percent were undecided, resulting in a net agreement score of a \"moderately strong\" +29. The agreement was highest in Metro Manila, with a net agreement score of +50 or \"extremely strong,\" followed by Balance Luzon at a \"moderately strong\" +29, Mindanao at a \"moderately strong\" +26, and the Visayas at a \"moderately strong\" +21. Net satisfaction with the President (good +38) tends to be lower among those who disagree that the government probably has people who secretly observe and report drug users and pushers, compared to those who agree (very good +52) and were undecided (good +47). The SWS has been releasing a series of surveys gauging public opinion on several aspects of the drug war.   ",

Ayon kay Col. Romeo Brawner, deputy commander ng Task Group Ranao, ilan sa mga nasagip nila kamakailan bilang bahagi ng clearing operations ay mga anak at asawa ng mga Maute. Ngunit iimbestigahan pa rin ang mga nasagip, lalo na ang mga misis, dahil posibleng mga tagasuporta ito ng teroristang grupo. \"Iniimbestigahan ng [Criminal Investigation and Detection Group] 'yong mga asawa kasi kailangan nating malaman kung ano involvement nila,\" ani Brawner sa panayam ng DZMM. Batay kasi sa kuwento ng ilang bihag, may ilang asawa ng mga Maute na nakipagsagupaan din laban sa tropa ng pamahalaan. Bahagi rin umano ng clearing operations ang paghanap sa mga naiwang \"stragglers\" na tagasuporta o mismong miyembro ng Maute. \"Ginagalugad po natin lahat ng mga sulok-sulok, mga butas [at] tunnels. Sinisiguro po natin na hindi po nakatago dito ‘yong mga natitirang miyembro ng Maute-ISIS,\" ani Brawner.

Nahuli ng pulisya si Syahputra sa Barangay Loksadatu noong Miyerkoles, Nobyembre 1. Hahalughugin din ng mga eksperto ang cellphone na nakuha kay Syahputra sakaling may makalap ditong maaaring maging ebidensiya. \"Mayroon tayong mga forensic experts sa mga devices para makita kung sino ang mga kausap niya,\" ani Brawner.

            "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 04:15 PM",
            "content": "MANILA - Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is eyeing a “better looking” millennial to help him carry out the critical task of speaking on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Roque, 51, said he wants a deputy spokesperson younger than him to convey the President's message to younger Filipinos.  He said he has picked for the job his former student at the University of the Philippines College of Law who is currently preparing for the bar examinations. He has yet to tell his chosen one but he is confident that he could persuade him to accept the offer. “I want a millennial. Number two, I want someone better-looking... than me so that the women will fall in love with him. And I want someone who speaks better than me. I promise the women, you will like the person I have in mind,” Roque said during his first news conference in Malacañang. “There’s always someone who should be able to give the Palace position on different issues, and I think I’m choosing this person because I want a link between a 72-year-old President and the millennials of today. You will not be disappointed with my choice.” Roque said he needs a deputy since he wants to do some of his work in war-torn Marawi City, where government is setting a rehabilitation program after its liberation from Islamic State-inspired terrorists. The city, once a bustling commercial and cultural capital, was ravaged by five months of firefights between state forces and Maute terrorists.  “It’s an innovation that I thought of because the rebuilding is soon to begin and I think the people should know exactly what’s happening on the ground,” he said. “That’s why it’s going to be very difficult for me to be flying to Marawi every Tuesday evening. It’s a very long drive from Cagayan de Oro. It’s very complicated for security reasons and logistic reasons but I want to do that because I want to bring Malacañang to areas where, you know, attention should be devoted.” Roque, meanwhile, said he has no immediate plans of reorganizing the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “I’m not going to reinvent the wheel ‘no dahil naririyan na ‘yung karamihan sa kanila. I’m sure they can stay. And I will repeat what I have said: No one will lose their jobs because it’s Christmas. If there will be individuals that will be let go, we will wait until after Christmas and as I said, I would want to take advantage of the experience of people who are already here,” he said. “But please understand that as a Cabinet post, I also need to bring in people whom I can completely trust. And that’s the only reason why I’m bringing in new personalities.”",

            "timestamp": "Nov 02 2017 04:13 PM",
            "content": "MANILA (UPDATED) - Constitutionalists, human rights lawyers and several associations of law students launched on Thursday the legal alliance \"Manlaban\" to coordinate different legal challenges to extra-judicial killings (EJKs) and other human rights violations under President Rodrigo Duterte. In a strongly worded statement, the Mga Manananggol Laban sa Extrajudicial Killings described the conduct of President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war as \"a blatant disregard of the right to life.\" \"Thousands of victims who are poor and powerless have been targeted and brutally, nay mercilessly, executed by the state, its agents and proxies with blatant contempt and disregard of due process,\" the group said.  The convenors include Sen. Rene Saguisag, the constitutionalist Dean Pacifico Agabin, Edre Olalia and Neri Colmenares of the National Union of People's Lawyers, Dean Jose Manuel Dioko of De La Salle University and chair of the Free Legal Assistance Group; former Ateneo School of Government Dean Antonio La Viña; Dean Ernesto Maceda Jr of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila; June Ambrosio, a well-known champion of women's and children's rights and head of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) National Center for Legal Aid; former congressman and human rights lawyer Erin Tañada; Roberto Cadiz of the Commission on Human Rights; professors Victoria Avena and Roel Pulido, Rachel Pastores of the Public Interest Law Center; Evalyn Ursua and Cleto Villacorta III. Aside from their individual and organizational legal service programs, the group is pushing the advocacy for human rights by holding forums nationwide and helping in the training of paralegal volunteers. “We have never had a greater need for paralegal aid,” said La Viña. The group’s advocacy goes beyond the alleged 12,000 killings since the start of President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on drug users and sellers, to include all other extra-judicial killings, threats to freedom of expression and attacks against human rights defenders.  The Duterte administration has repeatedly said the 12,000 figure is wrong and exaggerated. It has insisted that the \"real\" figure is 3,967 \"drug personalities\" killed (from July 1, 2016 to October 25, 2017) in presumed-legitimate anti-drug operations where the suspects violently fought back, prompting law enforcers to act in self-defense.  Olalia also cited the need to challenge an array of authoritarian tactics introduced by the Duterte government, including the police practice of conducting house-to-house drug tests and the use of intelligence “drop boxes” and surveys that violate privacy to boost the list of targeted drug users. “With violence on all fronts of President Duterte's ‘war’, there is deep fear indeed among the living that death will come, for virtually any one, sooner, at the door,” Manlaban said.\n \nIt rejected Duterte’s oft-repeated claim that he first needs to wipe out the tentacles of narcotics gangs at the grassroots.\n \n“Extrajudicial killings have not worked before and will never work now,” Manlaban stressed.\n \n“The effective solution to the drug problem in the Philippines is cleaning up government of officials, including the police and politicians, who protect drug syndicates, effective prosecution of all involved, especially big drug lords, to dry up the supply chain, and inclusive economic development to uplift the people from penury and thus stem the demand for antisocial vices like drugs.” The lawyers dismissed as a myth the government's claim that its conduct of the drug war has popular support from Filipinos. All Filipinos should support a campaign against drugs, said La Viña.  But, he pointed out, surveys consistently show that majority of Filipinos are concerned about extra-judicial killings, scared that they could also fall victim, and believe that Duterte's campaign largely targets poor citizens. \"It is clear that there is no approval of its conduct,\" he said.  The lawyers stressed Manlaban’s non-partisan character and urged Filipinos to reject the government stance of equating dissent with destabilization. “Human rights has no color,” Tañada said in response to a question about Duterte’s claim of a “Yellow-Red” conspiracy. “Human rights are for everyone,” said La Viña. “We come from different political strains. We do not fear these accusations.” “Our records speak for us,” said Olalia, adding that the group’s members have consistently fought for human rights since the rule of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Last month, President Duterte ordered Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) to take the lead in the anti-drug campaign and placed the Philippine National Police (PNP) at the back seat after he suffered a third-quarter drop in his net satisfaction ratings, which analysts linked to his bloody war on drugs.  'PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY'  Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr., meanwhile, said the Palace respects the decision of the lawyers to organize themselves into a group, but he noted that police operations must be accorded presumption of regularity. “But as far as extra-legal killings is concerned, I came to this job knowing fully well the official position of the President, which he made public after the killing of Kian ‘no,” Roque said, referring to Duterte’s condemnation of the killing of teenager Kian delos Santos by Caloocan cops.  “He will not tolerate murders. He will only tolerate killings when it is in line with duty and when the engagement is legal and he had, in fact, asked that the police officers involved in the Kian killing be arrested by [Philippine National Police chief] General Bato [Dela Rosa].”",

            "content": "MANILA – Acting Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Thursday said he is not yet resigning from his post as Kabayan Party-list Representative as he has yet to receive his appointment paper. Roque, who shall hold the rank of a Cabinet secretary, said he was advised by some colleagues in the chamber to wait for his appointment paper and seek clarification whether he would need to hurdle the bicameral Commission on Appointments (CA). “I was given the advice though by some of my colleagues like Cong. Rodolfo Albano [that] unless you’re certain that you’re not going through the CA, don’t resign until you’re sure that one, you will not go through the CA, and if you do that, the CA had already confirmed you,” Roque told ANC. Roque cited the case of former Las Piñas Representative and now Public Works Secretary Mark Villar, who waited for his confirmation from the CA before relinquishing his post as a lawmaker. “I can assume (the position as a spokesperson) without resigning, and that works for me right now as Congress is still on recess anyway,” Roque said. Congress will resume its session on Nov. 20, while Roque is set to formally assume his post on Nov. 6, the day he will also attend his first Cabinet meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte. In a related development, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, who sits as chairman of the powerful CA, said there is no need for Roque to go through the bicameral body. Roque, meanwhile, said that aside from being the President’s spokesperson, he may also take on another role. He said he may also serve as an adviser of the Chief Executive on a particular issue, which he did not reveal. “It’s just an advisory position that would not be incompatible with the Cabinet appointment,” he said in a news conference in Malacañang. Some analysts have said Roque, an expert on international law, may be tapped for President Rodrigo Duterte's defense in the case filed against him before the International Criminal Court (ICC) over his alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings. Roque is the only Filipino lawyer who may practice law before the ICC.  On Monday, Roque said this would be up to the President.  In January, Kabayan Party-list \"removed\" Roque as its representative over loss of trust and confidence, citing his media statements accusing state lawyers of corruption.  The party said Roque was removed due to \"an overwhelming call among Kabayan Party-list members and supporters,\" and that his actions were \"severely damaging\" to the party-list. Despite this, Roque was not readily removed from his post as the review of his status remained pending before the House leadership. He has pending ethics cases against the group's second nominee Ron Salo, who had filed a disbarment case against him before the Supreme Court. ",

Roque, a human rights lawyer prior to becoming a lawmaker, previously said he can use his being a spokesperson to bring up human rights issues with Duterte and other government officials, especially those involved in the war on drugs, the administration of justice, and protection of human rights.

            "content": "MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte has tapped Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) chairperson Eduardo del Rosario as the new head of Task Force Bangon Marawi, as the government focuses on rebuilding the war-torn city of Marawi. Duterte’s Administrative Order No. 9 changes the composition of the task force, which was previously headed by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana. The task force was created on June 28 through AO No. 3 \"There is a need to reorganize Task Force Bangon Marawi in order to reflect the government’s current priority to rebuild and develop the settlement areas affected by the armed conflict,\" Duterte’s AO No. 9 reads. Del Rosario shall be assisted by the secretaries of defense and public works who will both serve as vice-chairpersons of the task force. \"The Chairperson of the HUDCC as head of Task Force Bangon Marawi shall have operational control and supervision of the said Task Force and the overall responsibility to ensure that the objectives of this order are accomplished,” the order reads. The administrative order also makes Del Rosario as head of the sub-committee on housing and subcommittee on security, peace and order, previously headed by the Cabinet Secretary and Interior Secretary, respectively. The government is gearing up for the task of building back Marawi City after the end of hostilities last week. The conflict left much of the former commercial center in ruins and displaced more than 200,000 residents. At least 1,100 were killed, most of them terrorists. Temporary shelters for displaced families will be ready by December, the government promised, as authorities continued to clear the city of stray explosives. Government has allotted P5 billion for the city's rehabilitation this year, while another P10 billion is set to be released next year. Lorenzana earlier said rebuilding the city may need up to P50 billion. Earlier, the Office of the Civil Defense said rebuilding Marawi City may take 2 to 3 years.",

            "content": "MANILA - Incoming Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Thursday he will not compromise his background as a human rights lawyer when he assumes the post. Roque, who represented the families of slain transgender Jennifer Laude and slain environmentalist Gerry Ortega, said there will be no compromise in his character when he becomes President Rodrigo Duterte's mouthpiece. \"Not at all. I probably would not have accepted this post had the President [not] clarified his position after Kian’s killing. But with the pronouncement of the President, he is completely in compliance with our state obligations on human rights, to protect and promote the right to life,\" he said in an interview with ANC's Headstart anchor Karen Davila. Duterte last week announced Roque's appointment, choosing the Kabayan Party-list Representative to replace Ernesto Abella, whom he had known for decades. Critics have questioned Roque's acceptance of the post as he would be joining an administration heavily criticized for alleged human rights abuses in the drug war. But Roque said he does not believe the President could have ordered summary killings. \"The perception is he’s behind the killings. I’m here to tell them as a lawyer, there’s no evidence that he ordered the killing and there’s no evidence that we’re in anyway in breach of our obligation to investigate and to prosecute,\" he said. The 51-year-old lawmaker said he will not change himself despite the new job, adding that he will never become an apologist for the President because the Chief Executive's marching order was simple: \"Do not lie.\" \"It’s too late for me to change. It’s too late for me to become a different person. I would remain who I am. My convictions will remain the same,\" he said. \"I take on a job and I take on a job with a purpose. I want to put the communication of the President in the proper legal context and I want to be instrumental in making history in this country, not just a witness to history in this country,\" he added. Roque, who has voted against the death penalty in the House of Representatives and is vocal in his opposition to lowering the age of criminal liability, said he will only speak of the President's stance on these pet measures and not his. \"I will be (a) spokesperson. I will have to mouth the President’s positions on these issues. So I will say, the President supports the death penalty. Is that my personal belief? No, and people know it because of my voting record in the House,\" he said. \"It’s not my business to argue about the policies of the President. My business is to restate the policy of the President and to provide the correct legal context in case he is not understood,\" he said. He said he accepted the position as the spokesperson to take advantage of the opportunity to call the police and inquire about the progress on the the investigation and prosecution of the perpetrators. \"Maybe that’s why God said we should give you this opportunity because that’s the most active and most effective manner in which I can contribute to solving one of our problems, the problem of killings,\" he said.",

Isa pa sa tinitingnan nilang anggulo ay ang posibilidad na may kinalaman ito sa pagdukot sa dalawang magkapatid nitong nakaraang linggo kung saan ang mga suspek ay pawang armado din.

            "content": "MANILA - A former senator who authored the Anti-Hazing Law criticized fraternity brothers who said UST law freshman Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III died of cardiac arrest or multiple organ failure, not hazing. According to former Senator Joey Lina, whether Castillo died of cardiac arrest or multiple organ failure is immaterial. He said proof that hazing occurred is enough to prosecute the suspects. \"That kind of defense is very lame. In short very, very weak. The law is clear: if there is hazing and if it is proven, and the person hazed died or suffered physical injuries, there is a penalty,\" he told ANC Thursday. Arvin Balag, the leader of Aegis Jvris fraternity, and his brod, John Paul Solano, both said in their counter-affidavits that Atio may have died of a pre-existing heart disease, and not hazing. They both pointed out that Castillo had a condition that increases the risk of heart failure. Horacio Castillo Jr., the victim's father, meanwhile refuted these claims, saying \"blunt trauma\" caused his son's death. Lina believes the prosecution has enough evidence to prove hazing happened. He said hematoma on Atio's body, the paddles in the Aegis Jvirs library, and DNA samples will make for a strong case. The former lawmaker also said the evidence corroborates the testimony of Mark Ventura, who claimed that he was present during the initiation that led to Atio's death. \"All of these taken together at this stage in time will build a strong case against the perpetrators,\" said Lina.",

Martin Tambien, plant manager of Palm Concepcion Power Corporation, told ABS-CBN News they started cleaning up and repairing the facility last Oct. 22 as part of their annual preventive maintenance.

Hindi kasama ‘yong asawa namin sa giyerang lintik na ‘yan,” ani Melgie.  Ayon naman kay Alma, pinakamahirap ang ipaliwanag sa dalawang maliliit na anak kung bakit wala pa ang kanilang ama. “Gusto kong magalit, pero hindi ko alam kung kanino,” ani Alma.  Hiling nina Evelyn, Melgie, at Alma na ituloy ng mga awtoridad ang paghahanap sa kanilang mga asawa.

            "content": "TAIPEI—The first plane from Manila landed in Taipei on Wednesday as Taiwan commenced a trial 9-month visa-free travel regime for visitors from the Philippines. Among its passengers was a Filipino media crew invited by the Taipei city government to taste local delicacies and visit tourist attractions in the capital city. Sig Aldeen, a blogger and television host making his first-ever visit to Taiwan, said he never had Taiwanese cuisine before. After tasting Taiwanese hamburger and stinky tofu, he said their very distinct flavors impressed him. The media workers were welcomed by Taipei's Deputy Mayor Chen Chin-jun, who said he hopes they enjoy their stay in Taiwan and will help to promote the island's tourist attractions and food after they return to the Philippines. Statistics show that more than 200,000 visitors came to Taiwan from the Philippines from January to September this year, a 70 percent increase compared with the same period last year. The Manila Economic and Culture Office, the Philippines' de facto embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, welcomed the Taiwanese government's decision to grant visa-free entry to Filipinos for up to two weeks for tourism, business, visiting relatives and other purposes. Its Deputy Representative Carlo Aquino told Kyodo News that he expects the program will \"open the floodgates for Filipinos who wish to visit Taiwan as tourists but were stymied by the stringent visa requirements imposed by the Taiwan office in Manila before the adoption of the new policy.\" The program is partly aimed at advancing the government's \"New Southbound Policy\" that covers the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, six South Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand. It hopes visitors from those countries could offset a significant slump in tourists from mainland China, which had displaced Japan as the largest source of visitors in 2010. There has already been a significant increase in visitors from ASEAN countries since Taiwan relaxed visa rules for them in August last year. Over 200 million of them came during the year before that, up from about 1.5 million the previous year. Malaysians and Singaporeans already enjoy full-fledged 30-day visa-free entry to Taiwan, while the same applies to passport holders from Brunei and Thailand during a trial period lasting until July 31 next year.",

The late Mayor Parojinog, his wife Susan, his brother Octavio, and sister Mona were laid to rest in their mausoleum at the Mt. Malindang Memorial Garden. The first to visit on All Saints' Day is Aldong’s sister Aida Vasquez. She said they used to celebrate their mother’s birthday every November 1 but now, it’s different.  “The pain is still here, still so fresh,” she said. Supporters of the family also dropped by to light candles and offered prayers for the family. Former city councilor Roger Regalado brought flowers and lit candles for the late mayor.  “We really could not forget what happened. We want to remember the mayor’s contribution in Ozamiz,” he said. Mayor Parojinog and his kin were among 16 people killed last July 30, when their family's security personnel allegedly fought policemen who were supposed to serve search warrants. The same operation led to the arrest of Ozamiz Vice Mayor Nova Princess Parojinog and her brother Reynaldo Jr. following the alleged discovery of half a kilo of shabu in their home. Police and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) have launched separate probes into the bloody operation against Ozamiz's top political clan amid the Duterte administration's war on drugs.",

            "content": "LONDON—At least 15 million teenage girls worldwide have been forced into sex — often by partners, relatives or friends — yet only one in 100 sought help, the United Nations said on Wednesday. Cameroon had the highest rate of sexual violence, with one in six teenage girls experiencing forced sex, the U.N.'s children's agency (UNICEF) said in a report which examined data from more than 40 countries. \"This idea of women being at the disposal of men is a big factor driving the experience of sexual violence of girls,\" report author Claudia Cappa told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In the majority of cases, the abuser was known to the victim - with acts of sexual violence carried out by husbands, boyfriends, family members, friends and classmates. UNICEF said widespread sexual violence against teenage girls could hinder global progress towards achieving the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - a plan to end poverty, hunger, achieve gender equality and protect the planet by 2030. The number of girls who have been forced to have sex is likely to be far higher than 15 million as many are reluctant to come forward and data is lacking in many countries, it said. Abuses ranged from child sexual exploitation in the Dominican Republic's tourism industry to online sexual abuse in the Philippines. The report also highlighted projects to combat violence, including self-defense classes in schools in Malawi. Better laws to protect children and more support from social services are vital to bring about change, UNICEF said. \"What has proved to be particularly successful has been working with governments to develop national action plans that try to bring together different sectors, such as education and the justice system,\" said Cappa. Prompted by sexual abuse allegations against American film mogul Harvey Weinstein, millions of women and girls around the world have been sharing their experiences of harassment and abuse on Facebook and Twitter with the hashtag #MeToo. Weinstein, accused by a number of women of sexual harassment and assault in incidents dating back to the 1980s, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Di ko pa rin tinatanggal yung pantalon niya, yung shorts niyang naiwan, pati yung mga damit niya sa cabinet parang di ko pa malet go,\" she shared.  (Sometimes I get scolded by my mother...I still keep his pants, shorts and his clothes in the cabinet.

            "content": "MANILA - Hundreds of Filipinos heard mass in Rome over the weekend to promote the cause for the sainthood of the late Ilocano Bishop Alfredo Florentin Verzosa. A crowd of Filipino migrants, mostly Ilocanos, attended a mass on Oct. 29 presided by Nueva Segovia Archbishop Emeritus Ernesto Salgado to promote the cause for Verzosa's beatification and canonization, said a report by CBCP News. The mass was held at the Church of Santa Maria Addolorata at the Piazza Buenos Aires in Rome, Italy. Priests, mostly chaplains of Filipino Catholic migrant communities in Europe, concelebrated the Mass. CBCP News also reported that the Missionary Catechists of the Sacred Heart and the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia are promoting the cause to sainthood as part of the celebration of Verzosa’s episcopal consecration centenary this year. The cause for Verzosa's beatification was opened in his native Vigan in 2013. The diocesan inquiry finished on April 2 last year, and the official report or positio is set to be reviewed \"by a team of historians, theologians and, eventually, by some cardinals,\" CBCP News said.  If affirmed, the cause will be elevated to the Pope for the declaration of the “venerable,\" or one worthy of veneration. To be canonized a saint, there should be at least two confirmed miracles attributed to the \"venerable\" after his or her death. As a priest, Verzosa fought for the preservation of Roman Catholicism amid the Aglipayan schism at the onset of the 20th century. He was also the bishop of Lipa, Batangas during the so-called \"miracle of roses\" or the shower of petals during a reported apparition in 1949, which the Vatican later declared \"not worthy of belief.\" The Vatican later clarified that the said \"miracle\" was simply an event in Verzosa's life and is not the main concern and purpose of the beatification cause. Verzosa died on June 27, 1954 in his hometown. There are currently two Filipinos canonized as saints: San Lorenzo Ruiz, canonized in 1987, and San Pedro Calungsod, canonized in 2012. ",

Noel Del Prado ang disinterment o paglipat ng isang bangkay sa ibang libingan. Nakapaloob ang mga patakaran ukol sa disinterment sa Presidential Decree No. 856 o 'Code on Sanitation.'  Ayon sa batas, kinakailangang makakuha ng permiso mula sa lokal na pamahalaan upang ipalipat ang bangkay. Ito'y idudulog pa sa city o municipal health office. Paliwanag ni Del Prado, health officer ang mangangasiwa upang matiyak na walang pahamak na maidudulot sa kalusugan ng publiko ang paglipat sa bangkay. \"Ang layunin ng Code of Sanitation [ay] mapangalagaan ang kalusugan ... hindi lamang [ng mga] naiwan ng kanilang mahal sa buhay, kundi ‘yong buong pamayanan,\" ani Del Prado. Dalawang permit ang ipakukuha: sa lokal na pamahaalan ng kasalukuyang libingan, at sa lokal na pamahalaan ng paglilipatan. Ibig sabihin, kung nakalibing ang bangkay sa San Juan, halimbawa, at ililipat ito sa Maynila, kinakailangang kumuha ng permit sa mga health office ng parehong lugar. \"Bawat lipat niyan (bangkay), pagkilos, may pahintulot sa apektadong LGU (local government unit),\" ani Del Prado. Maaaring ilipat ng libingan ang yumao matapos ang tatlong taong pagkakalibing. Kung delikado at nakahahawang sakit naman ang ikinamatay ng bangkay, kinakailangan ng limang taong pagkakalibing bago ilipat ang bangkay. Sa ilalim ng batas, dapat disimpektahin ang bangkay o mga labi na ililipat bago ilagay sa matibay at mahigpit na sinarang sisidlan. Bahagi ang talakayan sa serye ng Usapang De Campanilla ngayong Undas 2017 na magbigay ng karagdagang kaalaman ukol sa mga batas na may kaugnayan sa pagpapalibing.",

Sa kabila nito, naghahanda pa rin ang pamunuan ng Manila North Cemetery sa pagdagsa ng mga tao kapag tumila ang ulan. Sa Manila South Cemetery naman, umabot na sa 60,000 ang bilang ng mga bisita ngayong tanghali. Sinabi rin ni Maribel Bueza, pinuno ng Manila South Cemetery, mas kaunti ito kumpara noong nakaraang taon dahil sa panahon. Tuloy-tuloy rin ang pagdating ng mga tao sa iba pang sementeryo gaya ng Himalayang Pilipino at Bagbag Cemetery sa Quezon City, Tugatog Public Cemetery sa Malabon, at Loyola Memorial Park sa Marikina. -- May ulat nina Dennis Datu, Raya Capulong at Kevin Manalo, ABS-CBN News",

            "content": "Ano nga bang mga requirement ang itinakda ng batas bago pahintulutan ang paghihimlay ng isang bangkay? May tinatawag na 'Code on Sanitation' o Presidential Decree No. 856 na naglalaman ng mga patakarang may kaugnayan sa pagpapalibing, ayon kay Atty. Noel Del Prado sa programang \"Usapang De Campanilla\" ng DZMM.  \"Walang libing na maaaring gawin nang hindi doon sa itinakda ng batas,\" ani Del Prado. Ayon sa batas, pangunahing pangangailangan sa pagpapalibing ang death certificate, na maaaring kuhanin ng kaanak sa doktor ng pumanaw. Ito'y upang mabigyan ng patotohanan ang pagkamatay ng indibidwal. \"Siya (doktor) ang magsesertipika na patay na talaga ‘yong tao at ilalagay din doon (certificate) ang oras [at sanhi] ng kaniyang kamatayan,\" ani Del Prado. Itinakda rin ng Sanitation Code na dapat isa't kalahating metro ang lalim ng paglilibangan. Ayon kay Del Prado, dapat ang paglilibingan ay siksik at matatag. \"Hindi ‘yong ‘pag nilagyan ng tubig, guguho ‘yong lupa,\" aniya. Awtopsiya, may 'foul play'? Sa ilalim ng batas, ang mga taong may karapatan sa bangkay lamang ang makapagbibigay ng pahintulot upang sumailalim ito sa awtopsiya o pagsusuri. \"As a general rule, sila (may karapatan sa bangkay) ‘yong masusunod so puwede nila ipa-autopsy, puwede silang tumanggi,\" paliwanag ni Del Prado. Kung balak ipasuri, dapat itong ipagbigay-alam agad sa mga lokal na awtoridad.  Ngunit puwedeng ibang tao rin ang humiling ng awtopsiya, lalo na kung may palatandaan ng \"foul play\".  Maaaring ihain sa piskalya ang hiling na awtopsiya sa bangkay lalo na kung kahina-hinala ang pagkamatay nito. \"Nangingibabaw dito ‘yong mas mataas na, kumbaga sa sistema ng ating batas, ‘yong pinahahalagahan ng batas, ‘yong katotohanan at katarungan,\" ani Del Prado. Ipinag-uutos din ng batas na dapat ilibing sa loob ng 48 oras matapos mamatay ang isang bangkay na hindi pa naembalsamo. Kapag ang sanhi naman ng pagkamatay ay nakahahawang sakit, dapat ilibing sa loob ng 12 oras matapos mamatay ang bangkay.  Hindi rin ilalantad sa publiko ang bangkay at tanging mga nakatatandang miyembro ng pamilya ang papayagang makadalo sa libing. Bahagi ang talakayan sa serye ng Usapang De Campanilla ngayong Undas 2017 na magbigay ng karagdagang kaalaman ukol sa mga batas na may kaugnayan sa pagpapalibing.",

            "content": "MANILA - An Indonesian national who claims to have fought alongside the Maute terrorist group in Marawi City was arrested by authorities in Lanao del Sur, Wednesday. The Indonesian identified as Muhammadin Ilham Syaputra was arrested by police because he did not look like one of the locals and was seen with his clothes drenched after swimming across the Lanao Lake from Marawi City to nearby Barangay Loksadatu. \"When he was caught, basa 'yung ano niya (damit). He was carrying something in his bag. May baril, grenade, at pera na Philippine, Indonesian, at Malaysian (sa bag niya),\" Senior Supt. John Guyguyon, acting chief of the Lanao del Sur Provincial Police Office, said in a press conference. Guyguyon said they have yet to determine the amount of cash confiscated from the terror suspect. He said the suspect's cellphone will be sent to Manila to check its call and message logs. \"Isa lang siya sa mga leg workers. According to him, nag-iintel (siya). He has a bullet wound sa may side. He is claiming that he shot one of his Indonesian allies because he wants to escape Marawi,\" Guyguyon said. Indonesian passports were also retrieved from the suspect.\n \nGuyguyon said police are coordinating with the Bureau of Immigration to verify if the suspect and his other alleged Indonesian cohorts who sympathized with the Maute group entered the country via the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Cases will be filed against the Indonesian national to prevent him from leaving the country, Guyguyon said. Military officials said Syaputra is claiming that there are still dozens of Maute terrorists in Marawi City, but Joint Task Force Ranao Deputy Commander Romeo Brawner Jr. sees no need to reactivate combat operations in the war-torn city. Government declared the end of hostilities in Marawi City on Oct. 23, exactly five months since firefights erupted between state troops and Islamic State-linked Maute terrorists. Foreign terrorists were known to have fought alongside local extremists during the conflict. At least 1,100 people, most of them terrorists, were killed and more than 200,000 Marawi City residents were displaced during the crisis. Government has begun planning the city's rehabilitation.",

            "content": "MANILA- For the first time since the death of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos nearly 30 years ago, his family finally got to mark their first All Souls' Day at the Heroes' Cemetery this year. The Marcos family on Wednesday held a mass near the tomb of the late strongman who hurriedly buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City last year. Bongbong Marcos, son of the late strongman, said the event is highly significant for their family. \"Mabuti naman at hanggang ngayon ay naalala pa ang kaniyang mga naitulong at nagawa para sa bansa sa panahon na siya'y buhay pa at nagseserbisyo,\" he said. (It's good that until now people still remember his service to the country when he was still alive.) \"I remember the moments of greatness during his presidency but also the moments of intimacy. I'm lucky to have known him in that regard, perhaps not the same as other people, but I had the benefit of knowing him as a father, as a person, as a man,\" he added. The entire Marcos family was present except for the former dictator's daughter, Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos. The younger Marcos also expressed gratefulness to their supporters and noted that it is important for the youth to study his father's presidency. \"Mabuti naman at naalala pa at napag-aaralan pa ng ating mga kabataan ang tungkol sa mga pangyayari,\" he said. (It is good that the youth still study and remember history.) The Marcos tomb has been an attraction to people visiting the Libingan since the former strongman's hurried burial last year amid claims his family was embarking on a political revival despite thousands who suffered under his two-decade-long rule. President Rodrigo Duterte allowed the burial at Libingan, which was the late strongman's last wish, according to his family.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated 8:05 p.m.) — The Philippines continues to bolster its military despite President Rodrigo Duterte's move to improve relations with China, a defense analyst said. According to Alexander Vuving of the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, the build-up of Philippine military forces has hit a plateau between 2007 and 2012 when military spending remained the same. The standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal, 120 nautical miles off Manila's coast, from April to June 2012 led the government to jack up military expenditure by 136 percent between that year and 2016. The United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines invalidating China's nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea. \"It is noteworthy that President Duterte’s about-face regarding the 2016 South China Sea rulings and his pivot to China do not significantly affect the Philippines’ force modernization,\" Vuving said. \"The 2012 standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal may prove to be a watershed in the evolution of the Philippine strategic culture, reverting a decade-long neglect of the air force, navy, and coast guard,\" he added. READ:   South China Sea: Beyond the Hague ruling Manila's reliance on the United States for its external defense and its focus on internal threats, such as Muslim and Maoist insurgencies, have resulted in the \"chronic neglect\" of its navy, air force and coast guard, according to Vuving. Past attempts at modernization, he said, have failed due to economic problems and lack of funds. In 1995, the Philippines passed a law calling for the modernization of the AFP following China's occupation of Mischief Reef, which exposed its lack of capability to protect its territory. However, this plan was halted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \"A Capability Upgrade Program to implement the AFP Modernization Act of 1995 was constantly underfunded although it was reprioritized in 2005,\" he said. The extension of the AFP modernization program was taken as one of the priority pieces of legislation in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-216, he said. READ:  Tribunal ruling: Blunting China’s realpolitik approach in the South China Sea dispute The 2012 Scarborough standoff was what accelerated the upgrade of the AFP. \"The standoff with China at Scarborough Shoal between April and June 2012 led to China’s de facto control of the reef and its surrounding waters,\" Vuving said. \"This prompted Manila again to pass, in late 2012, a new law (Republic Act 10349) that renews and accelerates the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.\" In recent years, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Air Force have each launched programs to acquire military hardware to beef up their long-neglected fleets. The Philippine Air Force launched a modernization plan titled, \"Fight Plan 2028,\" in 2014 which would see the PAF addressing incursions between 50 to 75 percent of the territory by 2020 and the entire Exclusive Economic Zone by 2028. \"This appears to be extremely ambitious, as the Philippines possesses only 12 FA-50PHs in 2017. The PAF has plans to acquire six more FA-50PHs and 12 multi-role fighters capable of air superiority,\" Vuving said, noting that the PAF became combat-capable again only in 2015 after losing its air fighting capacity in 2002. READ: Palawan within range of China's jets, missiles in South China Sea  The Navy, whose ships are either four decades old or operative since World War II, meanwhile launched a modernization plan called, \"Strategic Sail Plan 2020,\" which aimed to procure up to six frigates, 12 corvettes, 18 offshore patrol vessels and three anti-mine ships. It also targeted the acquisition of strategic sealift vessels, landing craft, patrol gunboats, assault craft, maritime patrol aircraft, naval and utility helicopters, and submarines, Vuving said. \"The intention, indicated in 2011 and reiterated in 2013, was to acquire three diesel-electric submarines, possibly of the Kilo-class,\" Vuving said but noted that the Philippines was unlikely to acquire a submarine until 2025. READ:  Duterte hopeful China will stop expansion in disputed sea The Philippines also acquired two newly-built frigates in 2013 and awarded a contract worth $337 million to South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries for two ships that could displace 3,000 tons and could be equipped with anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.  Through Japan's official development assistance, the Coast Guard procured 10 multi-role response vessels (MRRVs), and two 250-ton Parola-class MRRVs were delivered. \"In another program, the Philippines purchases five new-built vessels from France, including one 82-meter offshore patrol vessel (OPV) and four 24-meter fast patrol boats. The 1,400-ton OPV is expected to be delivered in 2018,\" he added. READ:  Shifting tactics: China advances 'four sha' claim in South China Sea The Philippines was also able to secure an agreement with Japan for Tokyo to build two high-endurance MRRVs during President Rodrigo Duterte's visit there in August 2016. The first one is expected to be delivered by November 2020 while the second one will be ready by March 2021, Vuving said. \"With these ships, the PCG will have 22 vessels larger than 100 tons with a total displacement of 7,700 tons by the end of 2018. This represents a 103 percent growth in tonnage and a 100 percent increase in number of ships during 2008-2018,\" Vuving added. ",

In a series of statements on Facebook, Aguas clarified that he has no other intention but to make sure Isabel recover for the sake of their son, who is only 14. “I am in constant communication with Isabels current partner, Arnel, and told him for the record that I have no intention on stepping on his shoes (ifever he feels uncomfortable with me being there). I am there for my magLola (Hubert is only 14).. And of course to contribute whatever I can for the revival and recovery of Isabel,” Aguas said. Aguas, who landed in Qatar on October 31, even took pictures with Arnel and thanked him for understanding.    In another post on November 1, Jericho gave an update on the actress’ condition. “Bringing a Dr. From spain is not an option anymore. Mama and her sister in spain now is requesting for another Drs opinion coping from the cuban hospital here in Qatar instead,” he said.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The bellwether index soared past the 8,500 territory for the first time on Thursday on the back of the US Federal Reserve’s positive view of US economy. The Philippine Stock Exchange index gained 150.76 points or 1.80 percent to 8,516.02—a fresh all-time high since the bourse closed to its previous best finish of 8,497.74 last October 17. The PSEi traded between a low of 8,321.65 to a high of 8,543.80 as trading resumes after a two-day holiday break. “Philippine markers traded into new territories once again as it made up for lost time with regional markets closing higher during our 2 day holiday. Economic data from several days was rather positive, which helped boost sentiment,” Luis Limlingan of Regina Capital Development said in a text message. The US Federal Open Market Committee maintained the funds rate target range at 1-1.25 percent at its November meeting, as widely expected. But according to Limlingan, the “main surprise” was the upgrade of the growth assessment to “a solid rate” from “rising moderately.” “The statement noted that this growth occurred ‘despite’ disruptions from the hurricanes, and it explicitly attributed the decline in September payroll employment to the storms,” Limlingan explained. “This return to a ‘solid’ pace of growth—last referenced in the January 2015 statement—underscores the Committee’s more positive view on real activity, following softness in parts of the economy over the last two years,” he added. The broader all-shares index rose 65.04 points or 1.33 percent to 4,956.97. Most of the counters were positive led by financials, which climbed 63.40 points or 3.17 percent to 2,064.46. Only the mining and oil counter declined on Thursday. Total value turnover amounted to P9.5 billion. Meanwhile, net foreign buying amounted to P758.47 million.

            "timestamp": "November 2, 2017 - 6:23pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — In the face of intense competition among economies in providing better business climate, the Philippines is keeping its “ambitious” target in terms of ease of doing business after its latest global ranking dropped significantly despite its improved score. In the World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2018 report, the Philippines’ ranking plunged 14 notches to 113th from the previous 99th spot across 190 economies. The World Bank, however, said the current ranking is not comparable to the one published in the Doing Business 2017 report “because of methodology refinements.” READ: Phl drops in WB business rankings According to Trade Secretary and National Competitiveness Council chair Ramon Lopez, the government is still eyeing to reach the “top 20 percent” of 190 countries tracked by World Bank before President Rodrigo Duterte ends his term in 2022. “It’s an ambitious target but we will still try to do it,” Lopez told a press conference on Thursday. “It’s time to improve our target... parang aiming for the stars tayo,” he added. “In other words, achieving all those right number of procedures, right number of cost per capita—those targets are the ones we’ll seriously consider.” On the distance-to-frontier metric basis, the Philippines’ score saw a slight improvement as it went from 58.32 in Doing Business 2017 to 58.74 in Doing Business 2018. However, the country’s 2018 DTF was below the average of 62.7 across East Asia and Pacific economies. The DTF measures the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies, according to World Bank. Asked if it is “safe” to assume that the Philippines’ ranking will recover, NCC co-chairman for the private sector Bill Luz—who joined Lopez in the same news conference—said: “Nothing is safe because the other countries are also moving.” “The higher you move up, the competition will get tougher. We have to push the score,” Luz added. Meanwhile, for Lopez, the Philippines won’t pay much attention to rankings as the government focuses more on improving its score. “Ang importante satin actually ‘yung score natin will jump to... I think the highest now is somewhere to 70 plus to 80 plus. So ‘yon ‘yung target natin,” the trade chief said. “The ranking will be secondary because the bottomline, ‘yung score kasi reflects the ease of doing business na ini-implement natin,” he added. “If you hit the highest score, you’re up there in the ranking. But even without looking at the ranking, you know that you are providing ease of doing business.” According to the World Bank, the country stands out regionally in the Resolving Insolvency component, with a global rank of 59th. Over the past year, the report said the Philippines also implemented two key reforms to improve the business climate for small and medium enterprises. These are in the areas of getting electricity connection and paying taxes. Despite these continued reforms, however, the World Bank said small and medium-sized businesses still face significant regulatory challenges in the Philippines, leaving room for further improvements especially in the areas of starting a business, enforcing contracts and protecting minority investors. In a statement on Wednesday, the NCC said the impact of improvements introduced by the Duterte administration in the second half of 2016 “may not have been fully experienced yet” by the businessmen surveyed during the first five months of 2017. It also listed 10 priority projects that must be implemented to improve the country’s ranking. “Improving ease of doing business in the Philippines is an endeavor that involves the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. It is a whole-of-government effort,” the NCC said. Globally, New Zealand topped the Doing Business 2018 report, followed by Singapore, Denmark, Korea and Hong Kong. Completing the top 10 are the US, UK, Norway, Georgia and Sweden. The Doing Business report is an annual publication of the World Bank, which reviews regulations that enhance or constrain business activity.",

According to its organizers, the musical event titled “Rise 2 Shine” at the Smart Araneta Coliseum would be rescheduled but the date has yet to be announced. The organizers are yet to provide an explanation behind the postponement of the event. Korean actor and performer Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon, was supposed to headline “Rise 2 Shine.” The concert would have been his return to the country after seven years. The concert is for the benefit of Marawi war victims, Make Your Nanay Proud Foundation and Ko-Ph World Foundation, which supports Filipino-Korean families and children. The organizers then apologized for the sudden rescheduling of the event and sought for the ticket holders’ understanding. “On behalf of the committee, we would like to apologize for this unforeseen situation all the performers will be the same,” the organizers said in its official statement. “We will keep you posted for the new schedule,” it added. Despite the organizers’ assurance that the event would be rescheduled with the same line-up of artists, Rain’s company issued a separate statement, saying that the Korean star would not participate in the benefit concert due to a contract issue. “As the organizer; KO- Ph. has been dishonest in fulfilling the performance contract, we have come to the decision that it is impossible to go ahead with the performance. Our decision is therefore 'not to participate in the performance',” Rain’s company said in a statement. “We hope to have the understanding of our fans, and we will pay more attention and do our best to avoid such happenings in the future,” it added. Other artists who were supposed to perform in the concert were Sam Concepcion, Isabelle de Leon, Kris Lawrence, Jay-R, Loisa Andalio, Krissha Viaje, Bendeatha, Pinoy Boyband Superstar, Miko Juarez and Gab Umali, Cursebox, Dasuri Choi and Jinho Bae. The organizers said all tickets for the original show would still be honored for the rescheduled event but they also allow refund at the TicketNet.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines – PBA commissioner Chito Narvasa leaves his fate in the hands of the PBA board of governors. Narvasa, however, will not go away yet, saying he’ll fight for the proper rules and procedures to be followed. Being eased out by seven PBA board members but called by five other PBA governors to stay on, Narvasa said he’s staying on until the board resolves a contentious issue in the league by-laws regarding terminating and hiring a PBA commissioner. “They’re all grown men. They will find a way. I hope that the board talks among themselves, and I want clarified on the matter, not for me, but for the future commissioners of the league,” said Narvasa. “I know that I’m here only temporarily, but as long as the issue isn’t resolved, I will not abandon the PBA which we all love, all the Filipinos love,” Narvasa also said. He said he’s heeding the call of his lawyers and the five PBA governors to fight for the procedures. “I’m willing to resign as I don’t need this. I don’t want enemies and I want the people in the PBA happy. I’m ready to sacrifice. But for principle, then I must stay,” he said. “The board must be able to determine what’s the right decision, what’s the right process, then come up with the right decision,” he added. He agrees with the stand of the SMC-led bloc “to fight for the Office of the Commissioner.” “What if they always bully someone that they don’t like, the Office of the Commissioner will weaken, and it would always be subject to who is the most powerful among team owners,” he said. “I’m fighting that nobody, however powerful they are, can frighten, threaten the Commissioner’s Office. It should be left alone.”  ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated 8:05 p.m.) — The Philippines continues to bolster its military despite President Rodrigo Duterte's move to improve relations with China, a defense analyst said. According to Alexander Vuving of the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, the build-up of Philippine military forces has hit a plateau between 2007 and 2012 when military spending remained the same. The standoff between the Philippines and China over Scarborough Shoal, 120 nautical miles off Manila's coast, from April to June 2012 led the government to jack up military expenditure by 136 percent between that year and 2016. The United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines invalidating China's nine-dash line claim over the South China Sea. \"It is noteworthy that President Duterte’s about-face regarding the 2016 South China Sea rulings and his pivot to China do not significantly affect the Philippines’ force modernization,\" Vuving said. \"The 2012 standoff with China over the Scarborough Shoal may prove to be a watershed in the evolution of the Philippine strategic culture, reverting a decade-long neglect of the air force, navy, and coast guard,\" he added. READ:   South China Sea: Beyond the Hague ruling Manila's reliance on the United States for its external defense and its focus on internal threats, such as Muslim and Maoist insurgencies, have resulted in the \"chronic neglect\" of its navy, air force and coast guard, according to Vuving. Past attempts at modernization, he said, have failed due to economic problems and lack of funds. In 1995, the Philippines passed a law calling for the modernization of the AFP following China's occupation of Mischief Reef, which exposed its lack of capability to protect its territory. However, this plan was halted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. \"A Capability Upgrade Program to implement the AFP Modernization Act of 1995 was constantly underfunded although it was reprioritized in 2005,\" he said. The extension of the AFP modernization program was taken as one of the priority pieces of legislation in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-216, he said. READ:  Tribunal ruling: Blunting China’s realpolitik approach in the South China Sea dispute The 2012 Scarborough standoff was what accelerated the upgrade of the AFP. \"The standoff with China at Scarborough Shoal between April and June 2012 led to China’s de facto control of the reef and its surrounding waters,\" Vuving said. \"This prompted Manila again to pass, in late 2012, a new law (Republic Act 10349) that renews and accelerates the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.\" In recent years, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Air Force have each launched programs to acquire military hardware to beef up their long-neglected fleets. The Philippine Air Force launched a modernization plan titled, \"Fight Plan 2028,\" in 2014 which would see the PAF addressing incursions between 50 to 75 percent of the territory by 2020 and the entire Exclusive Economic Zone by 2028. \"This appears to be extremely ambitious, as the Philippines possesses only 12 FA-50PHs in 2017. The PAF has plans to acquire six more FA-50PHs and 12 multi-role fighters capable of air superiority,\" Vuving said, noting that the PAF became combat-capable again only in 2015 after losing its air fighting capacity in 2002. READ: Palawan within range of China's jets, missiles in South China Sea  The Navy, whose ships are either four decades old or operative since World War II, meanwhile launched a modernization plan called, \"Strategic Sail Plan 2020,\" which aimed to procure up to six frigates, 12 corvettes, 18 offshore patrol vessels and three anti-mine ships. It also targeted the acquisition of strategic sealift vessels, landing craft, patrol gunboats, assault craft, maritime patrol aircraft, naval and utility helicopters, and submarines, Vuving said. \"The intention, indicated in 2011 and reiterated in 2013, was to acquire three diesel-electric submarines, possibly of the Kilo-class,\" Vuving said but noted that the Philippines was unlikely to acquire a submarine until 2025. READ:  Duterte hopeful China will stop expansion in disputed sea The Philippines also acquired two newly-built frigates in 2013 and awarded a contract worth $337 million to South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries for two ships that could displace 3,000 tons and could be equipped with anti-ship, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine weapons.  Through Japan's official development assistance, the Coast Guard procured 10 multi-role response vessels (MRRVs), and two 250-ton Parola-class MRRVs were delivered. \"In another program, the Philippines purchases five new-built vessels from France, including one 82-meter offshore patrol vessel (OPV) and four 24-meter fast patrol boats. The 1,400-ton OPV is expected to be delivered in 2018,\" he added. READ:  Shifting tactics: China advances 'four sha' claim in South China Sea The Philippines was also able to secure an agreement with Japan for Tokyo to build two high-endurance MRRVs during President Rodrigo Duterte's visit there in August 2016. The first one is expected to be delivered by November 2020 while the second one will be ready by March 2021, Vuving said. \"With these ships, the PCG will have 22 vessels larger than 100 tons with a total displacement of 7,700 tons by the end of 2018. This represents a 103 percent growth in tonnage and a 100 percent increase in number of ships during 2008-2018,\" Vuving added. ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III ordered the Bureau of Customs to create interagency anti-smuggling task forces on the regional level to beef up the government's fight against the illegal entry of goods especially in the provinces. Dominguez said that the cooperation among the BOC, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and other relevant government agencies should go down to the regional level to ensure that provincial operations against illegal trading practices were coordinated. “We would like the cooperation between the BIR and the Customs to go down to the regional level.  They have to be meeting regularly on the regional level, not only in the national headquarters (in Manila),” Dominguez told Customs Commissioner Isidro Lapeña during a recent Finance executive committee meeting. READ:  ‘Shabu importer’ admits bribing Customs execs Dominguez emphasized that the BIR and BOC should be meeting regularly on the regional level, not just in the national headquarters in Manila. Considering that most of the illegally-traded goods that enter the country are sold in areas outside Metro Manila, Dominguez said anti-smuggling operations should be strengthened in the different regions of the Philippines. The finance chief cited the recent joint operation by the BIR and National Bureau of Investigation in a commercial establishment in Cabanatuan City which was found to be holding 480 master cases of illicitly-traded cigarettes. The BOC is currently embroiled in a massive smuggling controversy following the discovery that more than P6 billion worth of illegal drugs was able to enter Manila's ports despite the government's vaunted intensified anti-drug operations. READ:  Trader claims paying P92-M bribes to BOC The illegal drugs were later found in a warehouse in Valenzuela by agents of the BOC and the NBI. It was also revealed during a series of Senate hearings that corruption persisted at the BOC, with no less than former Customs Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon being accused of accepting bribes running into millions of pesos upon assumption of the agency's leadership last year. Although he maintained his innocence, Faeldon resigned and was replaced by Lapeña who previously headed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Weeks after his appointment, Lapeña launched a five-point program in a bid to clean the BOC and improve its performance. READ:  New Customs chief bringing own team The BOC commissioner said that he would eliminate the \"tara\" system, increase revenue collections, strengthen the government's anti-smuggling efforts and improve the incentives and reward systems for employees. Topping the priority list of Lapeña is ridding the agency perennially rated as one of the most corrupt government agencies of illicit practices and graft. He said that he would do this by imposing a \"no tara, no gift and no take\" policy at the Bureau. A \"one-strike\" policy is also in effect, according to Lapeña, and this could be seen by the firing of district collectors at the Port of Manila and the Manila International Container Port. He added that there were also recommendations to remove other personnel from these two offices. Aside from these initiatives, Lapeña is also instituting lifestyle checks on BOC officials and employees. READ:  Broker names 8 officials in Customs payoffs",

It added: “It is time for him to reconfigure his brutal strategies into more humane, just and progressive solutions that address the social, economic and even cultural roots of the problems.” Movement Against Tyranny was launched last August by several groups and personalities critical of the actions and policies of the Duterte administration. On Tuesday, De La Salle Philippines President Br. Armin Luistro urged the school communities to “participate actively” in the activities on Sunday. “As one Lasallian community, we act in solidarity with other Filipinos in fight for dignity of human life and democracy,” Luistro, a former education chief, said. The “Lord Heal Our Land Sunday” event will commence a month-long period of church activities for the continued healing of the nation. It will end on December 5, which marks the solemnity of Immaculate Conception. READ: La Salle president backs healing walk vs killings on November 5",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Japan has proposed measures for its cooperation with the Philippines against illegal drugs over the next five years, which will start in 2018. The scope of the Japan-Philippines action plan includes relapse prevention among illegal drug users, prevention of using illegal drugs and poverty alleviation. The mid-and-long term action plan came out after President Rodrigo Duterte's visit in Japan and his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. To prevent the use of illegal drugs, Japan proposed to increase awareness and promote drug abuse prevention education for juveniles, households, schools and local communities. \"For this purpose, Japan will offer cooperation such as introduction of useful examples, human resource development, provision of materials and benchmarking of best practices in drug abuse prevention and eradication in select local government units in Japan,\" the action plan read. The Japanese government would also provide vocational training and educational opportunities for illegal drug users in areas with high poverty incidence and drug prevalence. \"In view of interrelation between poverty and the use of illegal drugs, Japan will offer cooperation for the Philippine government to break the connection between illegal drugs use and poverty by providing educational opportunities and vocational training and skills improvement activities after the implementation of needs survey,\" the action plan said. For the prevention of relapse among illegal drug users, Japan vowed to provide appropriate treatment and rehabilitation protocols based on coordination between rehabilitation centers and community-based treatment facilities. \"Based on the outcome of the support for rehabilitation centers, Japan will support the Philippine government’s effort to extend those measures in priority areas in the Philippines, by providing necessary assistance including development of policies, facilities and human resources,\" the action plan read. Japan will also share its experience in developing a national center for treatment in support to the Philippine government's effort to strengthen community support mechanisms. In this regard, the Japanese government will provide training to encourage interaction of concerned people. Japan has also offered to review the current classification of illegal drug users who are subject to corrective actions under a court order. The classifications would include those who should receive corrective treatment in rehabilitation centers or those who should receive voluntary therapy in community-based centers. Last April, the Japanese government donated an estimated 1.85 billion yen or P826 million to the Department of Health for the upgrading of rehabilitation centers and enhancement of treatment protocols for drug dependents. The DOH signed the agreement with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency as part of the Consolidated Rehabilitation on Illegal Drug Users program.

According to the annual report of the World Economic Forum released November 2, the country dipped to 10th place this year from seventh place last year. It got a score of 0.790. The Philippines also ceded its position as the highest performer in the East Asia and the Pacific region to New Zealand, which scored 0.791. “A worsening performance on the wage equality for similar work indicator, dropping from 7th to 21st, partly accounts for this fall. The country also reopens a health and survival gender gap for the first time since 2006, although the educational attainment gender gap remains fully closed,” WEF said in its report.  A total of 144 countries were ranked based on indicators such as educational attainment, health and survival, economic opportunity and political empowerment. For the Philippines’ scorecard this year, it ranked first globally in terms of educational attainment indicator.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — There is no evidence that President Rodrigo Duterte is behind the drug-related killings allegedly attending the government's ferocious campaign to eradicate illegal drugs, his recently appointed spokesperson claimed. Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that as a lawyer he could say that there was no evidence to point to the complicity of Duterte in the mounting number of supposed drug-related killings and human rights abuses in the conduct of the administration's drug war. He added that there was also no proof that the government and its security services had been remiss in their duty to investigate and prosecute the people behind drug-related deaths which human rights groups claimed had already reached at least 12,000, a charge that authorities denied. \"The perception is he's behind the killings. I'm here to tell them as a lawyer that there's no evidence that he ordered the killing, and there's no evidence that we’re in any way in breach of our obligation to investigate and to prosecute,\" Roque said in an interview on ANC. READ:  Roque: Police cannot have own definition of extrajudicial killings He said that he could not imagine a lawyer who had experienced being a prosecutor for 10 years such as Duterte who would openly admit that he would violate the law. Roque also doused issues that his image as a human rights lawyer would pose a conflict of interest in his new position as the new presidential spokesman, the person primarily responsible to explain and clarify the pronouncements of the chief executive. \"I cannot imagine, I cannot fathom outside of the president's theatrics I cannot fathom a prosecutor who will openly admit that he wants to violate the law,\" he stated during the interview. He said that he would not have accepted the position if Duterte did not clarify that he was against illegal killings of suspects especially teenagers. He added that Duterte's denunciation of the killings of teenagers and other innocent people would show that the chief executive was \"in compliance\" with the country's obligations on human rights. \"I probably would not have accepted this post had not the president clarified his position immediately after Kian's killing. But with the pronouncement of the president, he is completely in compliance with our state obligations on human rights, to protect and promote the right to life,\" Roque said.

He also reiterated that his position against the reimposition of the death penalty and the lowering of the criminal age of responsibility remained even if the chief executive and his allies in Congress were publicly pushing for these initiatives. Despite his opposition to some programs, his job as the president's spokesperson was to \"mouth\" the president's positions. \"I will be [the] spokesperson, so I will have to mouth the President’s positions on these issues. So I will say, 'The President supports the death penalty.' Now is that my personal belief? No,\" Roque emphasized, adding that his voting record against these proposed measures would speak for itself. READ: Palace can get 'explosive,' Roque warns. Should we be worried?

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — After being cleared of graft over the alleged illegal grant of a gaming franchise, a former mayor of Lucena in Quezon was sentenced to up to eight years in prison for another case. In a 74-page decision promulgated on Oct. 20, the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division said Ramon Talaga Jr. was found guilty of graft for the anomalous award of a computerization project to an unqualified service provider. Ofelia Garcia, former city government planning and development officer and technical evaluation committee chairperson, as well as budget officer Ester Mabita and assistant treasurer Mercedita Capulong, both bids and awards committee members, were meted the same prison term. The anti-graft court also ordered the former officials’ perpetual disqualification from holding public office. Former city treasurer’s office employee Roderick Abella and private individuals Ma. Prances Pelobello, Dennis Peter Lopinac and Matias Soriano were acquitted for lack of evidence. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2010, the case stemmed from the award of a P36-million contract to Amellar Solutions in 2002 for the computerization of the city government’s revenue generation system. The ombudsman said Talaga conspired with his co-accused and resorted to “selective or limited source procurement” instead of holding a public bidding in violation of the Government Procurement Reform Act. Graft probers said the former officials “deliberately and unilaterally” changed the terms of reference of the project to qualify the software used by Amellar, giving the service provider unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. In a decision promulgated on Oct. 6, the Sandiganbayan’s Fourth Division acquitted Talaga in connection with the award of a bingo franchise to Jose Sy Bang Sr. in 2000. The court said the prosecution failed to prove that the grant of the franchise was in exchange for the businessman’s support for Talaga during a recall election.",

In a recent decision, the Sandiganbayan’s Third Division said the prosecution failed to support allegations of conspiracy between Esmeralda and his co-accused. Also acquitted were former municipal treasurer Cynthia Cabañero, Esmeralda’s secretary Pio Elumba as well as private individuals Edwin Romualdo of E.S.

In a complaint filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2008, the former officials were accused of not implementing the project despite the local government’s receipt of P1 million in financial assistance from the office of Sen.

However, in its ruling, the Sandiganbayan sided with Romualdo and Go’s defense that their only obligation under the contract was to supply the construction materials and heavy equipment. The Sandiganbayan gave weight to a Commission on Audit report which states that the construction materials and equipment were delivered on time. Records also showed that Romualdo and Go were awarded the contracts through public bidding.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has cleared former Igbaras, Iloilo mayor Jaime Esmeralda of a criminal case over the alleged unimplemented road rehabilitation project in 2004. In its 23-page decision promulgated on October 6, the court's Third Division acquitted Esmeralda and his four co-accused of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. “From the foregoing, it can be inferred that the accused public officers did not cause any undue injury to any party including the government or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of [their] functions,” the Third Division's ruling read. “Neither did the accused private individuals unduly benefitted from the project,” it added. The court said the prosecution also failed to support with convincing evidence its allegation of conspiracy among the accused. The decision was penned by Associate Justice Bernelito Fernandez with the concurrence of division chairman and Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang and Associate Justice Sarah Jane Fernandez. Acquitted with Esmeralda were former municipal treasurer Cynthia Cabañero and former secretary to the mayor Pio Elumba, as well as private respondents Edwin Romualdo of E.S. Romualdo Construction and Arthur Go of Supply and South Pacific Builders Center Inc. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2008, the graft case stemmed from the respondents' alleged failure to carry out the rehabilitation of Kinagdan-Mulangan Road and Cale-Indaluyon Road despite the municipal government's receipt of P1-million financial assistance from the Office of Sen. Franklin Drilon who hails from Iloilo province. The ombudsman said there was “no showing of rehabilitation” of either of the two roads amid a Program of Work which specifically required the grading of the road surfaces, furnishing, placing and compacting of the aggregate base and laying out of culverts which would allow water to flow under the road. The ombudsman said the accused public officials gave unwarranted benefits to Romualdo and Go, for payments made despite the projects' non-implementation. In its ruling, however, the Third Division pointed out that as established during the trial, the two projects shall be implemented through “contract by administration,” in which, the concerned agency, in this case, the municipal government of Igbaras shall be the one to carry out the projects “through its own personnel.” The Third Division sided with the Romualdo and Go's defense that under their respective contracts with the municipal government, their only obligation was to supply the construction materials and heavy equipment, respectively, and not the actual implementation of the projects. The court gave weight on a Commission on Audit Technical Inspection Report, which states that the construction materials and equipment for the projects were timely delivered. Furthermore, the court said records show that the supply contracts were awarded to Romualdo and Go through competitive public biddings, thus their receipt of payments, amounting P581,986 and P314,295 respectively, upon the delivery of the required items, was justified. The court also agreed with Esmeralda's defense that “the responsibility of implementing the subject infrastructure projects falls on the municipal engineer” in accordance with the Program of Work. The court noted that even the prosecution's own witness, then municipal engineer Anastacio Escobido, admitted during cross-examination that the responsibility of implementing the two infrastructure projects lies with him and his staff. Following their acquittal, the court ordered the lifting of the hold departure order issued against all the accused. The court also ordered the release of the bail bond that they posted for their provisional liberty.  ",

            "timestamp": "November 1, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — For Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, medical marijuana for compassionate use should be allowed in the country. According to Duque, he supports the use of cannabis for selected medical cases but security measures must be in place to prevent abuse. “Medical marijuana, as the bill is described, is for compassionate use. So, it should never be used by just anyone. There are people who qualify to benefit from medical marijuana,” he said, referring to House Bill No. 180 or the proposed Philippine Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act. Duque noted that in medical marijuana, “there must be very narrow applicability and must be strictly regulated.” The heath chief gave assurance that the Department of Health (DOH) is working closely with legislators on the technical aspects of the bill. “There are continuing consultations where we provide them our technical positions in order to ensure that the final version of the law will be clear and acceptable,” he added. Aside from this, the DOH is also making sure that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be fully capable of implementing the law if and when it gets approved. Last September, the House committee on health approved the bill which seeks the legalization and regulation of medical use of marijuana for some chronic conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or similar chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorders and epilepsy. Under Republic Act 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, marijuana or cannabis is classified as a dangerous drug. Government policymakers are not giving up on fulfilling President Duterte’s campaign promise of solving the illegal drug problem in the country. But instead of the original “three to six months” promised by the Chief Executive during the campaign period in last year’s national elections, the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) has set a more realistic target: a “drug-free” Philippines by the end of Duterte’s term in 2022. Based on the draft copy of the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drug Strategy (PADS) released by the DDB this week, being “drug-free” means that the country “has significantly reduced to manageable level the prevalence of drug use through expanded access to quality and evidence-based drug prevention and treatment interventions.” The document underscores five pillars of action to address the drug problem in the country, including drug supply reduction, drug demand reduction, civic awareness and response, alternative development and international cooperation. PADS, which is awaiting approval of the President, also highlights various priorities to achieve the objective of having a drug-free country by 2022. Priorities include institutionalization of community-based drug prevention and treatment and rehabilitation program, government subsidy for admission to rehabilitation center, random drug testing for students, review of existing policies and full implementation of existing laws. “Aside from supply reduction efforts, we would also like to focus on drug demand reduction programs or what we call the left-hand approach in the campaign against drugs,” DDB chairman Dionisio Santiago said. “These are preventive education, advocacy and civic awareness programs that aim to prevent people from abusing drugs and enlist their participation in the anti-drug campaign. Treatment and rehabilitation is also part of this strategy,” he added. Santiago announced last Monday the plan to launch a campaign that will address the drug problem from a different perspective. Called “Love Life. Fight Drugs,” the DDB chief said the campaign will focus on helping drug users free themselves from drug addiction. He said they hope the approach will reduce the killings related to the anti-illegal drug campaign. “We want to give opportunities to those who are being rehabilitated and in communities where there are drug addicts,” he said. In the same press conference, Santiago also said they would conduct next year a survey on drug prevalence, apparently in response to conflicting figures on the actual number of drug users in the country. “We want the figures that we release to be evidence-based and consistent,” he said in Filipino. Dionisio’s predecessor Benjamin Reyes was sacked by Duterte after he pegged the number of drug users to only 1.8 million, contrary to the President’s insistence that the drug problem is affecting as many as four million people. Reyes based his data on the results of a DDB survey conducted in 2015, while Duterte cited intelligence information from the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Santiago said the new survey may put an end to the confusion caused by the different data on drug prevalence. DDB deputy executive director for operations Earl Saavedra said they would want a credible survey firm like the Social Weather Stations or Pulse Asia to conduct the survey. He said, however, that they are still trying to figure out if the P15-million budget will be enough for project. “We want a survey instrumentality with the credibility and integrity to be able to release (believable) results to the public,” he added, noting that they would immediately start crafting the terms of reference by January. In addition to putting an end to conflicting data on drug prevalence, Saavedra said the survey would enable them to determine the impact of the fight against illegal drugs.",

Caritas Manila, the social arm of the Archdiocese of Manila, is giving away preowned coffins to poor families who want to give their dead a decent burial. Caritas Manila’s executive director Fr. Anton Pascual said they have been providing recycled but sanitized coffins under its Damayan program. Pascual said these coffins were donated to them after the families cremated the bodies of their departed loved ones. Aside from 50 coffins made of wood or steel, Caritas also has new urns they could give to those in need. “We want to raise the Church’s level of intervention for the poor. The Good Samaritan program aims to intensify our charity work for our poor brothers and sisters,” he added. Families who want to avail themselves of burial assistance should get in touch with Caritas Manila. The applicants must undergo a screening process to make sure that they are indigents. “We also have partnerships with Catholic cemeteries such as the La Loma Cemetery. We have more or less P5,000 to P10,00 budget for burial assistance. This is part of the corporal works of mercy – to bury the dead,” Pascual said. While the Church is against gambling, Pascual said they don’t stop families from holding gambling such as “sakla” during the wake to help them cover burial expenses. Sakla is popular at wakes in the Philippines. Relatives of the deceased person need not break things to break the cycle of death, according to Fr. Eutiquio Belizar Jr. of the Diocese of Borongan in Eastern Samar.  Belizar, who chairs the Diocese of Borongan’s Commission on the Doctrine of the Faith, said, “There are superstitious beliefs in parts of Eastern Samar associated with death that may cause concern among the faithful.” The Church official said some residents usually break bottles or plates before the remains are brought out of the house to stop the cycle of death. Another belief is when a funeral procession passes by the deceased person’s house twice, it brings bad luck to the family. To correct these beliefs, Belizar urged parish priests, pastors and lay persons to catechize the faithful about Christian teachings on death and the afterlife. First aiders and ambulances of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) will be on standby to assist travelers during the obserance of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day. PRC chairman and Sen.  Richard Gordon said they have mobilized volunteers to assist the public. More than 1,300 first aiders and foot patrollers were deployed in 170 cemeteries nationwide. The PRC set up 150 first aid stations, 40 of which are in Metro Manila. –  With Sheila Crisostomo, Rhodina Villanueva",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office on Tuesday said the supposed unauthorized benefits identified by the Commission on Audit have been “part and parcel” of what employees and officials receive for over two decades. In the joint statement of Chairman Jose Jorge Cruz and General Manager Alexander Balutan, PCSO said the benefits were covered by various approvals from the previous presidents since the administration of Fidel Ramos. Although it defended the said benefits, PCSO explained that the gaming firm has immediately suspended and stopped the releases or grant of these questioned benefits to its officials and employees. “The PCSO management will continue to abide with this instruction and our employees fully support the same,” the firm said. It added: “On the other hand, we completely trust that this issue will be settled judiciously and fairly by observing the appeals mechanisms laid down under the COA Rules of Procedure.” READ: COA: PCSO employees, officials got P500M in unauthorized bonuses in 2016 This came as a response to COA’s 2016 Annual Financial Report on Government Owned and Controlled Corporations, which identified PCSO as the state firm with the highest unauthorized allowances and bonuses granted to its officials and employees amounting P518.314 million. Of the said amount, P503.667 million was for “payments of allowances, bonuses and other benefits that were not supported by sufficient legal basis,” while the remaining P14.647 million “pertains to payments of allowances that were in excess of prescribed rates.” The state auditors said the allowances and other perks were given despite the gaming firm's unsettled disallowances from the previous years totaling P1.213 billion, which also stemmed from infractions of government compensation rules. PCSO noted that the notices of disallowances issued by COA are still not final as many of these are pending appeals. Based on the COA report, the PCSO's 2016 pay package to its officials and employees includes the following: Christmas bonus (P151.174 million), educational assistance bonus (P123.817 million), grocery bonus (P71.08 million), weekly draw allowance (P60.267 million), hazard pay given to non-public health workers (P27.535 million), revenue performance incentive pay (P23.222 million) and some smaller amounts of allowances and anniversary bonus. Other state firms identified in the COA report to have granted perks without legal basis were Small Business Corporation (P46.448 million), National Electrification Administration (P23.683 million), Philippine Coconut Authority (P11.475 million), National Food Authority (P10.097 million), Apo Production Unit Inc. (P7.45 million), Human Settlements Development Corp. (P2.085 million) and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. or IBC-13 (P219,000). ",

Edgard Arevalo said among those who would perform in the concert are military talents and bands “Our homegrown talents will join Original Filipino Music artists such Kris Lawrence, Darren Espanto, Jason Dy, Richard Reynoso, and Jamie Rivera, among others,”  Arevalo said. The benefit concert is a follow-up on the first two “Song for the Heroes” shows held in 2015. The previous concert supported the families of the slain 44 Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police during the Mamasapano clash. Meanwhile, AFP Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero welcomed the continued support for the government forces. “Your Armed Forces of the Philippines is fully committed to fulfil our mandate, but we also need you as the battle that we are in entails so much the cooperative involvement of the civilian sector. And knowing that our sacrifices are duly recognized, we are strengthened by the support given by the people we have sworn to protect, and with this, we cannot thank you enough,” Guerrero said. “This inspiration draws us to a firm resolve to work harder, and remain as your most reliable AFP,”  he added. — Rosette Adel",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Leila de Lima supports President Rodrigo Duterte’s call for the immediate passage of the Bangsamoro Basic Law amid threats of terrorism and extremism. “While not a perfect piece of document, the draft BBL represents a huge and monumental first step at addressing, in very concrete terms, the long-standing aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters. Their core aspiration is of course genuine autonomy and meaningful self-governance,” de Lima said in a statement Tuesday. The detained senator believes the draft BBL only needs some tweaking or fine-tuning of provisions to hurdle any constitutional challenge. For her, Filipinos cannot afford to miss this big shot at peace and stability in the region. “The urgency in actualizing the proposed changes in the governmental, political, fiscal and justice structures for the Bangsamoro people, to supplant the discarded, deficient ARMM set-up, is most felt now, hence, imperative, given the lingering and worsening threats of terrorism and extremism in the area,” de Lima said. She added: “Time is indeed running out. I don't see any other option, except chaos and more suffering for the people, Moros and Christians alike, in the region.” On Sunday, Duterte called on Congress to expedite the passage of the proposed BBL. “If we do not act on it expeditiously, I think that we are headed for trouble. We must continue to talk and I will urge Congress to fast-track it because they are getting impatient,” he warned during the media briefing before departing for Japan. Duterte said he had committed to both the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front to pass the BBL. “That is a commitment. Not even a promise but a commitment to the Moro people,” Duterte said. Duterte said that enacting the BBL would help boost peace in Mindanao alongside the government’s efforts to rehabilitate the war-torn city of Marawi. The draft BBL that the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) submitted to Duterte last July 17 reached Congress in August but its transmittal did not indicate it was urgent.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Palawan province in the Philippines could be within range of China's fighter jets and cruise missiles if deployed on their reclaimed outposts in the Spratly Islands, according to a US think tank. Washington-based AMTI Center for Strategic and International Studies made projections on the range of China's jets and missiles based on their equipment deployed on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, which is claimed by China, Taiwan and Vietnam. The think tank noted that since 2014, Beijing has expanded its ability to monitor and project power throughout the contested waters through the construction of military assets on the Spratly and Paracel Islands. \"For the bases at Fiery Cross, Mischief, and Subi Reefs, fighter and missile ranges represent expected future deployments based on the hangars and shelters built to accommodate those assets,\" the think tank said. Fiery Cross Reef (Kagitingan), Mischief Reef (Panganiban) and Subi Reef (Zamora) are also being claimed by Manila. \"These include new radar and communications arrays, airstrips and hangars to accommodate combat aircraft, shelters likely meant to house missile platforms, and deployments of mobile surface-to-air and anti-ship cruise missile systems at Woody Island in the Paracels,\" the think tank said. The US think tank's map shows that the expected range of YJ-62 Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles can reach Palawan province and the northern part of Malaysia. On the other hand, the expected radii of China's J-10 fighter aircraft have a broader range than even reaches the Sulu Sea and a larger portion of Sabah, Malaysia.       The AMTI map depicted Beijing's ranges of known high-frequency radar installations as 300 kilometers while the smaller arrays were shown as 50 kilometers. Last June, the AMTI released satellite imagery showing that China is nearly complete in the construction of military facilities in the disputed waters despite the warming up of Manila's relations with Beijing. In July 2016, the Hague-based arbitral tribunal ruled that the three maritime features were originally high-tide features that do not legally generate their own continental shelf or exclusive economic zone. Beijing, however, refused to honor the arbitral decision and insisted that they have indisputable sovereignty over the region based on their nine-dash line claim in the South China Sea.

Luistro said Luzon-based schools would gather at the Chapel of the Divine Child in La Salle Green Hills at 2 p.m. After the orientation, they would walk to EDSA Shrine for the mass at 3 p.m. The former education chief encouraged the Visayas and Mindanao-based schools to hold similar activities and coordinate with local parishes.

            "content": "TOKYO – Japan yesterday promised to help the Philippines rebuild conflict-torn Marawi City as well as other infrastructure in a deepening of ties to counter China’s regional influence. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made the pledge in a joint statement with President Duterte following talks here. Duterte on Oct. 23 announced the end of five months of military operations in Marawi held by Islamic State-inspired terrorists in a conflict that destroyed much of the city’s center and displaced some 300,000 people. “The government of Japan recognizes that rehabilitation and reconstruction of the city of Marawi is extremely important,” the joint statement declared. “We will provide maximum support to the restoration and reconstruction of Marawi City and we will strengthen support of Mindanao toward the establishment of an autonomous government.” Japan also offered to help with other projects ranging from rail infrastructure to river defenses, including a possible 600-billion-yen loan to help fund development of a subway in Manila. The meeting was an opportunity for Abe to discuss security in Asia ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in Vietnam in November. “I confirmed with President Duterte that we are both maritime nations sharing basic values and strategic interests,” Abe said. Duterte thanked Abe for supporting the Philippines’ efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism and his readiness to provide timely assistance to residents affected by the Marawi crisis.   “It is, therefore, fitting and proper, that after the liberation of Marawi City from the grip of Maute terrorists, my first official visit overseas takes place in Japan --- a true friend who has stood squarely behind the Philippines in my country’s onward advance (to) greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President said.  The two countries, Abe  said, would address common issues including North Korea and “a free and open Indo-Pacific.” Japan is concerned about China’s growing power in the South China Sea and sees cooperation with the Philippines, which lies on the waterway’s eastern side, as key in helping prevent Beijing’s influence spreading into the western Pacific. Duterte, unlike his predecessor Benigno Aquino III, has been less critical of Beijing’s island building in the South China Sea. The Philippine leader is set to return to Manila today after an audience with the Japanese emperor. Abe and Duterte will travel to Vietnam for the two-day APEC meeting from Nov. 11, which US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend. Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other countries in the region will meet again in the Philippines after the APEC gathering for the ASEAN and East Asia summits that will be chaired by Duterte.",

More than 500 sailors, Marines and Seals of the Philippine Navy were welcomed as heroes by their spouses, children and parents. The soldiers were honored in recognition of their heroism followed by a motorcade from Manila’s Pier 13 to the Marine Base at Fort Bonifacio in Taguig. Members of the Fleet Marine contingent deployed in the Naval Forces Western Mindanao (NFWM) were also received by Philippine Navy Flag Officer In Command Vice Admiral Ronald Joseph Mercado during the ceremony. Mercado said the gallant men and women of the Philippine Navy who fought in Marawi would be given much-needed rest. “After this heroes’ welcome, we will be giving them a short break to be with their families,” he said.  “They are in high spirits, having successfully completed their mission in Marawi City,” Mercado added. He said the Philippine Navy alone suffered 36 casualties and over 300 injuries during the Marawi siege. The Philippine Navy spent nearly P500 million in ammunition and fuel for its naval and delivery operations during the five-month Marawi siege. Mercado said the battle for Marawi was costly. In Zamboanga City, the military gave a heroes’ welcome to troops who were among the composite team that killed Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute. The Fleet Marines and sailors were received by NFWM commander Rear Admiral Rene Medina and their families upon their arrival from Iligan City. Western Mindanao Command chief Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. also received the contingents of the Army Scout Ranger who were deployed in Marawi. Galvez commended the soldiers for liberating Marawi from terrorists. Families of the soldiers and civilians showered the Marawi troopers with confetti and balloons. Thousands joined a symbolic prayer at the Marawi City hall to highlight its liberation from the Maute terrorists. The event was led by Mayor Majul Gandamra, officials of the Lanao del Sur provincial government, Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and representatives from the Wesmincom. The government can rebuild the devastated Marawi into a model city of Mindanao with proper planning, sufficient funding and political will, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito said yesterday. Ejercito, chairman of the Senate committee on urban planning and housing, said he and other members of the panel would visit Marawi along with experts to come up with a master plan to rebuild the city.

In a pre-departure press conference at the Davao airport on Sunday night, Duterte said he has to temper his language during his visit, when delivering the Filipinos’ warm greetings for Japan. The President cited the close ties between the Philippines and Japan, attributing it partly to the respect the two nations have for each others’ leaders. Duterte said it is important for him to visit the emperor this time, as he was not able to do so the last time he was in Tokyo. He said the death of the emperor’s uncle was one of the reasons his visit was called off. The emperor is expected to relinquish his throne next year.  “It’s kind of a homage to see the emperor before he abdicates,” Duterte said. He is the first head of state to visit Japan following Abe’s reelection last week.  This would be Duterte’s second visit to Tokyo and his third meeting with Abe, who reciprocated the gesture with a trip to Manila and Davao City in January. The President and his party, which included 17military battalion commanders and their staff who defended Marawi City, are expected to return home tonight. The officers joined the President on an Airbus 320 chartered flight that took off from Davao City on Sunday night, Philippine Army chief Maj. Gen. Rolando Joselito Bautista said. The trip to Japan was sort of a reward to the officers for defending Marawi. Another trip, this time to Hong Kong, is being arranged for female officers who took part in the operations against Maute terrorists. Duterte promised an all-expense-paid trip to Hong Kong for the female soldiers who helped defeat the Mautes.

Foremost among our shared concern are developments in the Korean peninsula and the continuing missile launch tests of North Korea,” Duterte said after his meeting with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe here.  “We condemn these tests and call on all concerned stakeholders to return to the negotiating table to peacefully resolve the situation,” he added.  North Korea has continued to beef up its nuclear program despite economic sanctions by the United Nations and widespread condemnation by the international community.  The rogue state previously threatened to launch ballistic missiles toward Guam, where a US military base is located, prompting US President Donald Trump to declare that he would meet any threat to his country with “fire and fury.”  Japan, South Korea and East Asian countries that also host US military installations are also bracing for possible missile attacks. Last April, member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said they are concerned over the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula as these seriously threaten peace, security and stability in the region and the world. Before leaving for Japan, Duterte said a nuclear war was “unacceptable” as he cited the need for stakeholders to hold talks with Kim. “All leaders agree that he is a dangerous man. You must remember that he is a leader of his people… Whatever he proclaims himself to be, somebody has to talk to him,” he added.   Duterte said it would be “good” if the US, Japan and South Korea talk with North Korea to convince the totalitarian state to stop the threats. But he believes that only China can calm down the North Korean leader.  Duterte said Kim should also be given an assurance that there is  no plan to oust him.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — University of Santo Tomas law dean Nilo Divina yesterday denied any criminal liability in the fatal hazing of law freshman Horacio “Atio” Castillo III by members of the Aegis Juris fraternity. Divina, who says he is on leave as a member of Aegis Juris, appeared before the Department of Justice (DOJ) and sought the dismissal of murder, hazing and obstruction of justice charges filed against him by Castillo’s parents. In a 30-page counter-affidavit, the law dean argued that he cannot be held liable as an accomplice of the fraternity members involved in the fatal hazing simply because he was not aware of it and only learned of Castillo’s death after the initiation rites. “Contrary to the complainants’ claim, through their counsel, I could not have had any knowledge that hazing is being practiced or that Atio was being hazed,” he stressed. Divina lamented that the complaint failed to cite an overt act he committed to make him liable for Castillo’s death, pointing out that the allegations against him were based on “wild speculations, conjectures and surmises” and mere association with the fraternity.  “My mere continued membership in the fraternity (albeit on an inactive status) cannot be basis of their claim of my alleged criminal knowledge, acquiescence or approval of the hazing,” read his answer. Divina reiterated that he has taken a leave from the fraternity since he became dean of the law school and that the university administration implements a total ban on hazing rites. He also denied the allegation that he was part of the cover-up of Castillo’s death by their fraternity based on his statement before the Senate inquiry that he issued a blanket suspension “to allow those responsible to escape undetected... and at the very least to avoid being directly questioned by the MPD (Manila Police District).” The law dean argued that such action cannot be considered as a crime under the Anti-Hazing Law, stressing that the preventive suspension of the fraternity members was meant to “protect the student body and to alleviate their fears brought about by news reports concerning Atio’s death with the possible complicity of some members of Aegis Juris.” Divina said he was not involved in the cover-up since he even reported the matter to the Father Regent who represents the university administration in the law school immediately upon learning about the incident.",

            "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos are reminded to observe a garbage-free All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day by bringing their trash home instead of leaving it in cemeteries. The aftermath of the holidays meant to honor the dead usually produces tons of garbage, composed mostly of plastic and other non-biodegradable materials. “Let us not forget to be garbage-conscious so we can help promote a clean environment,” Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo, chairman of the House committee on Metro Manila development, said. He issued the reminder as millions are expected to flock to cemeteries nationwide to honor their departed relatives. The tradition has become a reunion of sorts for some families, who even hold parties in cemeteries. “It’s very important for people to be mindful of what they are going to bring to the cemeteries and how they plan to deal with it after the celebrations,” Castelo said. Last year, more than 1,000 tons of garbage were collected from several cemeteries in Metro Manila alone. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority dispatched 168 trucks to haul the trash, composed mostly of styro-packaging products, paper, plastic cups, baskets and dried flowers. Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu appealed to Filipinos to honor their dead by keeping the final resting place free of garbage. Graveyards are usually turned into dumpsites by cemetery goers during All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day, Cimatu said. He advised the public to bring trash bags and segregate their waste at the cemetery. Hospitals across the country will be on code white alert until Nov. 3 in anticipation of any untoward incident that may occur during the holidays. “This is to make sure that all health facilities are ready to address any emergency related to the observance of Undas,” Lyndon Lee Suy, spokesman for the Department of Health, said. He advised persons with health concerns to think twice before going to the cemeteries to avoid complications, as well as those who are planning to bring their children with them. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the public should also be cautious of the food and drinks that they would take to the cemeteries to avoid contracting illnesses such as typhoid fever, hepatitis and diarrhea. Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa placed all police units nationwide under highest alert to ensure an orderly and peaceful observance of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day. Dela Rosa directed all regional police directors to step up monitoring of all commercial establishments and other possible targets of lawless elements.  “We have not monitored any direct threat, but we are on full alert,” Dela Rosa said during a briefing at Camp Crame yesterday. He urged the public to be vigilant and immediately report to authorities any suspicious person, activity or package left unattended in cemeteries or along streets.  In the past, robbery groups such as acetylene and termite gangs took advantage of the holidays by digging tunnels to break into banks and other commercial establishments. Marawi Bishop Edwin dela Peña will instruct priests in his diocese to include in their prayers during All Saints and All Souls those who perished in battle, especially the fallen soldiers. “I will issue that call especially for people in my jurisdiction,” Dela Peña said, adding he is hoping other dioceses and local churches will do the same. Fr. Jerome Secillano of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines urged the faithful to pray not only for their dead relatives and friends, but also for those killed in the war against drugs as well as in Marawi. “May the Lord give them eternal peace away from the violent and destructive ways of the world,” Secillano said. Security on roads, airports, seaports, train stations as well as bus and jeepney terminals will be tightened during All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the move would ensure safe and efficient travel for everyone during the holidays. Task Force Alamid, an inter-agency council on traffic, has cleared roads of obstruction to ease traffic flow. Traffic personnel and volunteers from the Land Transportation Office, an attached agency of the DOTr, will assist traffic flow at the South and North Luzon expressways’ toll exits. Another attached agency, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, inspected bus terminals in Metro Manila to ensure the vehicles’ roadworthiness. The Manila International Airport Authority also inspected the facilities of all terminals of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. All Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines personnel are on heightened alert during the holidays. Maynilad Water Services Inc. will set up water stations in the Manila North Cemetery as part of its hydration support for the All Saints’ Day activities. The water stations will provide free water to cemetery goers in support of the Rescue 5 first-aid and public assistance project of TV5 News today and tomorrow, according to Maynilad president and chief executive officer Ramoncito Fernandez. Maynilad will also distribute free bottled water for motorists passing through the North Luzon Expressway, Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway and Manila-Cavite Expressway. – With Rhodina Villanueva, Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Evelyn Macairan, LouellaDesiderio",

            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — He’s not just a mouthpiece but also a staunch defender of his boss, so don’t make the mistake of crossing paths with newly appointed presidential spokesman Harry Roque. “If, in the past, you were able to throw stones without anyone hitting back, be warned that if you throw stones, I won’t just throw stones but hollow blocks,” Roque said in a video interview with Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson before they joined Duterte on a working visit to Japan the other night. “Stop throwing stones. If you want, just help the country with the many problems it is facing. Just wait for the adobe and hollow blocks that I will throw at you,” Roque warned. He clarified though that he also believes in “allowing the marketplace of ideas to flourish.” The President officially announced the appointment of Roque, former Kabayan party-list representative, as presidential spokesman replacing Ernesto Abella, who has reportedly been offered positions in other offices, including ambassador to either Australia or Germany. Roque said he looks forward to being able to communicate the government’s messages to the Filipino people in his new role. He noted that he has not had a negative experience with the press in the past and hopes to have a good working relationship with the media and the Malacañang Press Corps. Although his first Cabinet meeting would be on Nov. 6, Roque already got to work as presidential spokesman when he acted as moderator of the President’s pre-departure press briefing Sunday night. Duterte is confident that Roque would live up to expectations. “It’s in the messaging, actually. We cannot speak the same words altogether but how he would convey that message from me would be most important,” the President said. He refused to detail why he had to replace Abella and appoint Roque as presidential spokesman, except to say that “the reason is my personal decision, I am not about to explain why I did it.” Senators wished Roque good luck and advised him to make sure he clarifies the President’s messages. “I hope he (Roque) does a good job. I know he’s got a difficult job but just a reminder: he should balance things. He shouldn’t quarrel with everyone. Let’s not add to negativity. We should help clarify matters,” said Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito. “The President has a very colorful personality but that’s the way he is – no nonsense,” he added, noting that the President’s communications team should be at the forefront in mending strained relationships, especially with communities like the European Union. Senate Majority Leader Vicente Sotto III said each presidential spokesperson has his or her own style of speaking for the president, as detained Sen. Leila de Lima lamented that Abella’s departure could mean the “further decline of the level of discourse and language we could expect from now on from the President and his men.” Roque said he will have to wrap up his affairs in Congress and formally inform Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez about his new post. He plans to bring with him his staff of six to Malacañang and introduce changes in the setup in the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson. “But those things have to wait till after Christmas,” Roque said, adding that he still has to look into his new post and the policies and management of the office. He recalled that Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go first called on him about the position last Oct. 14 while he was on vacation in Japan. They met in a restaurant near Malacañang two days after. Roque met with the President on Oct. 27 during a dinner at the Marina Tuna Seafood Restaurant in Davao City where they discussed the offer for him to become presidential spokesman. Prior to this appointment, Roque also served as head of the Center for International Law, the Philippine-based human rights advocacy group whose lawyers represented families of the victims of the Ampatuan massacre and the kin of transgender Jennifer Laude.",

            "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "TOKYO – At least 25 business deals representing roughly $6 billion in new investments have been signed by Philippine and Japanese firms in a development that officials said affirmed investor confidence in the Philippines. President Duterte witnessed the signing yesterday of the agreements, which are expected to release Japanese investments in manufacturing, shipbuilding, iron and steel, agribusiness, power, renewable energy, transportation, infrastructure, mineral processing, retailing, information and communication technology, and business process management. “President Duterte met several Japanese companies and witnessed several B-B MOUs (business-to-business memoranda of understanding) and letters of intent on investment plans, joint ventures and expansion of operations in the Philippines,” Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said in a statement. “Total new investments (are expected to reach) $6 billion,” he added. A list of companies that signed the agreement was not available as of yesterday but incoming presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the deals would be undertaken by “big multinational” and “Filipino giant” corporations. “If I’m not mistaken, there were at least 25 agreements that were witnessed by the President today (Oct. 30),” Roque said in a chance interview here. “I think it’s because there is, number one, commercial predictability, number two, there is peace and order in the Philippines and there is conducive business environment where businesses are safe from unjust taking,” he added. Roque said the signing of business deals also highlighted the “very strong” relations between the Philippines and Japan. “It also proves that Japan continues to be one of our most active trading partners,” the incoming presidential spokesman said. Among the companies that signed business deals are the Steel Asia Manufacturing Corp. and Metro Pacific Investments, which forged agreements with Hitachi and Itochu. The group of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan was also scheduled to meet with Japanese firms NTT, Rakuten, Itochu, Mitsui, Marubeni, Densan and Hitachi. Lopez said he also met with his Japanese counterpart Hiroshige Seko to discuss ways to improve market access and lower tariff for Philippine agricultural products like banana, pineapple and mango. Asked about the Japanese trade minister’s reaction to his request to lower the tariff for Philippine agricultural exports, Lopez replied: “They took note of that and to be discussed in detail in the technical working groups under JPEPA (Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement).” JPEPA is the bilateral trade agreement between the Philippines and Japan. It was signed by former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and then Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi in Helsinki, Finland in September 2006. The agreement assures zero duties for more than 90 percent of Philippine exports to Japan and is expected to enhance the access of Filipino service workers to the Japanese market. It also requires the removal of tariffs by both Japan and the Philippines on almost all industrial goods within 10 years from the date of its implementation. The two trade chiefs also tackled the Industrial Cooperation Dialogue and ways to improve the supply chain for Japanese companies to benefit Philippine small and medium enterprises.",

            "title": "Duterte to swap notes on drug war with Trump",
            "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — Fighting drugs and terror is seen to highlight President Duterte’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in November in Manila during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Leaders Summit and Related Meetings. Speaking here with reporters Sunday night before departing for Tokyo for a three-day working visit, Duterte said Trump’s strong position against drugs is something he shares with the US president and that the issue would likely top their agenda – aside from terrorism – in their expected bilateral meet. He also promised to deal with Trump in the “most righteous way” during the ASEAN meetings on Nov. 12-13. “The fight against drugs, and all of these, I said, expect to be dealing with him around these topics,” Duterte added. Aside from drugs, Duterte said he might also discuss the issue of terrorism with the US leader. Trump earlier declared a national emergency over opioid addiction in the US, particularly fentanyl abuse, saying the issue has become a “national shame.” Reacting to Trump’s move, Duterte said he had recognized the problem early on as he again taunted former US president Barack Obama for his critical stand on Duterte’s vicious war on drugs. “I would deal with President Trump in the most righteous way, welcome him as an important leader, as a matter of fact, the important leader on this side of the planet,” the President said. “And, I would have to also listen to him what he has to say.” But before the Manila summit, Duterte and Trump are also expected to meet in Da Nang, Vietnam on Nov. 8-10 at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Trump will travel to Asia on Nov. 3-14 amid rising tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. He will be in Manila on the last leg of his trip, which includes visits to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam, to attend the ASEAN leaders’ summit and related meetings. Trump will meet with Duterte but will skip the larger meeting in Manila with heads of states and governments from China, South Korea, Japan, India, Australia and New Zealand. Duterte said he was glad Trump had also acknowledged the seriousness of the drug problem. “For example, like declaring a national emergency regarding the drug issue. But these are on the level of a societal problem. It’s not a problem of law and order. There are no warlords there,” the President further said. But Duterte explained the drug problem in the US is not the same as that of the Philippines. “Maybe, illegal ha – illegal handguns, very few, far and in between, not the kind of the drug problem that we have here. That including mayors and barangay captains are affected heavily,” Duterte added. The Philippine leader is known for his often profanity-laden tirades against the US, chiding Washington for treating the Philippines “like a dog,” despite the two nations’ longstanding relationship. The Philippines’ leader announced his “separation” from the US during a visit to Beijing a year ago, declaring he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve their South China Sea dispute through talks. Duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former president Obama’s administration about extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. But Trump, in a phone call to Duterte in May, praised the Philippine leader for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem” despite human rights groups’ condemnation of Duterte’s drug crackdown, in which thousands of people have been killed. Human rights, rule of law and due process are among “important developments” the two leaders would likely discuss during their bilateral talks, US Ambassador Sung Kim told foreign correspondents last week. Duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the Philippines, which his government denies. He defended his 16-month-old campaign last week, telling Southeast Asian lawyers at a gathering in Manila that he had been “demonized” and again denied allegations of state-sponsored killings of drug dealers and users. Duterte, speaking in Davao City on Sunday night, said the situation in the Korean Peninsula would be the main agenda item in his talks with Trump. “We are worried. If anything can go wrong, it will go wrong,” he said. “A nuclear war is totally unacceptable to everybody.” Duterte said it would be good if the United States, Japan and South Korea would sit down and talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and “tell him that nobody’s threatening him, that there would be no war and that if you can just tone down or stand down, stop the threats, and that would be the same for America.” Duterte previously described Kim as a “fool” and “son of a b***h” for “playing with dangerous toys.”",

            "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "ILOILO CITY, Philippines — Officials of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Region 6 wasted no time in serving the dismissal order yesterday against Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog. DILG lawyers arrived at 12:30 p.m. at Mabilog’s office at the Iloilo City Hall to serve the order. Lawyers Anthony Nuyda, DILG Region 6 director, and Cedrick Jaranilla, DILG-6 legal officer, together with Iloilo City lawyer Ferdinand Panes arrived at Mabilog’s office, which was already cleaned and the mayor’s personal items removed. Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III was sworn in as acting mayor to serve the rest of the term of Mabilog until the midterm elections in 2019. As earlier assured by Mabilog’s camp, the service of the order was done without fuss or resistance. Jaranilla read the dispositive portion of the order dismissing Mabilog from holding public office. “Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog is found guilty of serious dishonesty relative to his unlawful acquisition of wealth. Accordingly, he is meted penalty of dismissal from the service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations,” the order stated. “In the event that the penalty of dismissal can no longer be enforced against respondent, the penalty shall be converted into fine in the amount equivalent to his salary for one year, payable to the Office of the Ombudsman, or may be deductible from his retirement benefits, accrued leave credits or any receivable from his respective office. It shall be understood that the accessory penalties attached to the principal penalty of dismissal shall continue to be imposed.” “Jed Patrick Mabilog is hereby directed to cease and desist from exercising the powers, functions and privileges of the office of the City Mayor of Iloilo or from any other government position he may now or afterwards hold effective immediately upon receipt hereof,” according to Jaranilla, who read the order. “Furthermore, Mayor Mabilog is hereby directed to turn over all properties and documents to the office of and functions to Vice Mayor Jose Espinosa III, who shall assume office as local chief executive of Iloilo City who shall serve the unexpired portion of his term.” Lawyer Joenar Pueblo, Mabilog’s counsel, received the dismissal order. “As counsel, I will receive this but then again, as stated, this should be personally received by Mayor Jed, no citizen Jed Patrick Mabilog,” he pointed out. But the DILG-6 officials stated that the order is executory pending appeal. As Espinosa was present, he immediately took office. Espinosa said that he would only aim for good governance for the people of Iloilo City. He also vowed to continue the good things Mabilog has started. The newly designated mayor said that he would work to make Iloilo City a safer place where people could sleep peacefully and go out at night without any fear. Meanwhile, Councilor Eduardo Peñaredondo, Mabilog’s ally, said that they sympathize with the ousted mayor. Last Sunday, Pueblo said they will file a petition for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) following reports that the DILG will immediately implement the dismissal order. Pueblo will file this week a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, with the prayer for issuance of TRO before the Court of Appeals. “But if they can’t be stopped, we couldn’t do anything about. What we are asking is for them to wait until we could file a petition for a TRO,” he said. If the DILG would insist, Pueblo added they would just contest the dismissal order before the Court of Appeals, or even the Supreme Court. Last week, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed Mabilog’s dismissal after he was found guilty of serious dishonesty for his alleged questionable wealth. President Duterte has repeatedly accused Mabilog of being a narco-politician.",

            "timestamp": "October 31, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — If anyone is to be sued for the devastation of Marawi City during the five-month conflict between government forces and the Islamic State-linked Maute group, it should be President Duterte and no one else, according to the Chief Executive himself. “I hold myself solely responsible for what happened, including... the incidents there, the events that transpired. Sabi ko (I said), ‘I take full responsibility for all,’” Duterte said. In going after the Maute terrorists, the President also declared martial law in Mindanao, which is expected to be lifted by the end of the year.  He earlier declared the liberation of Marawi City from terrorists after the deaths of their leaders Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute.  A group of residents and concerned citizens is reportedly planning to file charges against the government for the assault on Marawi, which resulted in the displacement of more than 200,000 people and the deaths of more than 1,000, at least 169 of whom were government forces.  “Let me answer you here and now, that I declared martial law to answer the challenges of the moment and I take full legal, criminal and civil liability. Ako ’yun (It was me),” Duterte said during a press conference at the Davao International Airport here before he left for a three-day working visit to Tokyo the other night.  The President said it is within the rights of individuals, groups or organizations to file such charges even before the International Criminal Court.  “Yes. It’s well within their rights to do that. I agree… that if you have a gripe, and you think that justice should be done, and if they think that the Philippine courts would be prejudiced or biased, they can always go to the International Criminal Court,” he said. The Chief Executive likewise said he is amenable to the conduct of a deeper investigation on how the Maute group was able to get so much materiel to fight the government in Marawi City. Duterte said that as far as his office is concerned, it would be the executive department and the Armed Forces and the police that should study carefully how the fighting evolved and how to fight a new war. Duterte said government forces need more training in urban warfare. “That’s why… it is a universal fact that in the Middle East, it took them one year, two years to do it. It’s because there is always a high-rise building, where you can position yourself comfortably while waiting for the kill, and I said, in penetrating a lot of almost indestructible cover,” he said. Meanwhile, Duterte ordered government forces to finish off the remnants of the Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups by December, Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said. The Westmincom, according to Galvez, would redeploy the forces in Maguindanao, Basilan and Sulu to sustain its operations against the remaining terrorist cells. He said there are two prominent terrorists groups left in Maguindanao and their movements were being tracked in the areas of Piagapo and Butig towns. – With Roel Pareño",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 9:43pm",
            "content": "TOKYO – The Philippines and Japan are entering a “golden age” of strategic partnership, President Duterte said yesterday, as he thanked the Japanese government for its readiness to support his programs and the rehabilitation of battle-torn Marawi City. “Our commitment and resolve show the desire to further expand cooperative ties. I dare say that, considering what we have accomplished and achieved, the Philippines and Japan are building a golden age (for) our strategic partnership,” Duterte said after his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “It’s a commitment founded on the democratic values we hold dear. It’s a resolve that has withstood the test of time. Working together, we should have much to show and to be proud of in the years to come,” he added. Duterte is here for a two-day official visit that seeks to boost the ties between the Philippines and Japan. His visit came days after Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party won an overwhelming victory in recent snap elections. It was his second visit to Japan, which occupied the Philippines for three years during World War. Duterte first visited the East Asian country last year.  “As strategic partners, cooperation between the Philippines and Japan is expansive and multi-dimensional. Both sides recognize today that there is still ample room for even more significant growth in all areas of mutual concern,” Duterte said. Abe said it was a great honor to welcome Duterte, whom he described as his “dear and cherished friend.”   He also vowed to provide “maximum support” to the Duterte administration’s efforts to rebuild Marawi City, which was ravaged by five-month-long clashes between government forces and Islamist militants. “We will provide maximum support to the restoration and reconstruction of Marawi City and we will strengthen support of Mindanao toward the establishment of an autonomous government,” Abe said.  “Regarding the declaration of liberation of Marawi in Mindanao, I’d like to express my heartfelt respect for the leadership exerted by His Excellency President Duterte going forward in his efforts to fight terrorism and also for the stability in Mindanao and the development; and in his attempts to ensure this, we would like to provide full support to President Duterte’s approaches,” he added. Duterte thanked Abe for supporting the Philippines’ efforts to address terrorism and violent extremism and his readiness to provide timely assistance to residents affected by the Marawi crisis. “It is, therefore, fitting and proper that after the liberation of Marawi City from the grip of Maute terrorists, my first official visit overseas takes place in Japan --- a true friend who has stood squarely behind the Philippines in my country’s onward advance (to) greater peace, progress and prosperity,” the President said. Duterte said he was also honored to be the first Southeast Asian head of state and government to visit Japan since Abe’s electoral victory. Japan promised to swiftly provide equipment for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Marawi and surrounding areas. The Japanese government will also consider extending further assistance including possible support for road construction and improvement. Duterte also welcomed Japan’s willingness to provide a 1 trillion yen or about P430 billion package for the Philippines’ development projects. “I am pleased with Japan’s reiteration that it is fully committed to – as he described it – “give flesh” to the 1 trillion yen or close to nine billion dollars pledge (of) assistance to the Philippines,” the President said. “This covers huge impact and high value infrastructure projects that my country needs to sustain and spur our economic growth. There will be some of the most ambitious and groundbreaking projects, including the Metro Manila Subway project, and major developments in the regions and provinces,” he added. Abe vowed to fast-track the building of a subway in Metro Manila and the implementation of projects for the North South Commuter Rail. He said his government would implement medium to long term action plans related to illegal drugs and measures for maritime safety that would include efforts against terrorism. “We will proceed with cooperation to enhance coastal surveillance capacity building. And we will further provide support to strengthen safety in Sulu and Celebes Seas and other parts of the region,” the Japanese leader said. Abe said the mobile cooperation team launched this month by the Coast Guard would be conducting training exercises in Manila. “The Coast Guards of Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia will be participating toward the realization of an Indo-Pacific which is a free and open. We hope that this will be a model case for cooperation,” he added. The two leaders also promised to further promote bilateral cooperation in energy, employment creation, information and communication technology, environment, agriculture and disaster reduction. “I conformed with President Duterte that we are both maritime nations sharing basic values and strategic interests. And as such, Japan and the Philippines will cooperate to address common issues such as North Korea nuclear and missile issue and the only resolution of the abduction issue and realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific and also counter measures against terrorism and illegal drugs,” Abe said. “I would like to work hand in hand with my close friend President Duterte to further deepen the bonds of friendship between our two countries and we’ll cooperate towards peace and prosperity of the region and international community,” he added.",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 7:50pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The lawyers of Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno on Monday warned that the impeachment proceedings against her would turn into a \"one-sided\" affair if their camp would be barred from cross-examining witnesses who would testify against her. Sereno's lawyers also urged the public to remain vigilant especially against moves that would deprive the chief magistrate of her constitutional right to due process in the impeachment case being heard by the House Committee on Justice. \"What will happen is that the determination of probable cause will be a one-sided affair and we think that it should not be the picture seen both by the public and the members of the committee,\" Josa Deinla, Sereno's lawyer and spokesperson, said in a radio interview. Sereno's camp was reacting to the statement of House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez that she would be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses only if she would show up at the committee hearing. Alvarez claimed that Sereno's failure to appear would be tantamount to the waiving of this right, a proposition that the chief magistrate's lawyers disagreed with. According to Deinla, their legal team thinks that Sereno, just like any other ordinary respondent or accused, has the right to cross-examine the witnesses who would speak against her through her lawyers. They said this was part of the \"due process of law\" enshrined and protected by the Constitution. \"Under our Constitution, since she is the accused, Sereno has the right to be defended by her lawyers,\" Deinla pointed out. \"Only she has the right to decide whether or not to exercise this right since she is a respondent, who is similar to an accused, and not just a witness or resource person invited by Congress,\" she added. The chief magistrate's spokesperson said their legal team would insist on their motion to recognize her \"constitutionally guaranteed rights\" when the Justice Committee resumes its hearing on November 20. They also would like to know the position of the other members of the committee because so far it was only the speaker who expressed his opinion on the issue. Sereno's lawyers led by Alex Poblador sought confirmation from the justice panel in a motion filed on October 23 that persons testifying as witnesses or resource persons against the chief justice might be \"cross-examined by her counsel on her behalf.\" “The right to be heard and be defended by counsel in all stages of a criminal proceeding is a very basic right of an individual, which not even this Honorable Committee, indeed Congress, can take away from a respondent in an impeachment proceeding,” the lawyers said in the motion. They also inquired if they would be allowed to object to improper questions during the direct examination of the complainant's witnesses and be furnished with all documentary and testimonial evidence in support of the charges against Sereno. The House under Alvarez has been criticized in the past for allegedly allowing the \"slut-shaming\" of detained Sen. Leila De Lima after questions about her supposed love affair with her driver were asked during a committee hearing. Sereno is facing moves to impeach her from office following allegations by former Gloria Arroyo lawyer Lorenzo Gadon that she failed to declare income received from a case in which she represented the Philippine government. Gadon, a defeated senatorial candidate of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, also alleged that the chief magistrate had lived a lavish lifestyle. Political analyst Ramon Casiple recently revealed that Gadon was pursuing the case as revenge to what happened to Arroyo and former Chief Justice Renato Corona, an accusation that he denied.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Arvin Balag, believed to be Aegis Juris Fraternity's president, insisted he could not be held liable for the death of neophyte Horacio \"Atio\" Castillo III due to the complainants' failure to prove that he participated in the brotherhood's initiation rites. In his counter-affidavit filed before state prosecutors Monday, Balag said allegations made against him are \"not equivalent to proof,\" adding that his \"presence nor participation\" in the fatal initiation rites of Aegis Juris Fraternity was not proven by complainants. Murder, anti-hazing, robbery and obstruction of justice raps were filed against Balag and several other members of Aegis Juris Fraternity for the death of Castillo. Two separate raps were filed by the Manila Police District and the Castillo's parents. Balag pointed out that the complainants \"presented no witnesses stating my actual direct participation to the supposed illegal hazing done to Atio as a neophyte of Aegis Juris Fraternity.\" \"It is self-serving and purely hold speculative accusation in the absence of specific allegation of facts in the complaint showing my participation in the commission of the subject offenses,\" he added. Balag also denied being part of the Facebook conversation that discussed how to handle the death of Castillo. \"I hereby categorically and specifically deny that I have any knowledge or that I am a party in the conversation mentioned in the 'screenshots of conversation' derived from Facebook,\" Balag said. After the denial, he then proceeded to argue that the screenshots could not be considered as admissible evidence as they were not \"properly authenticated.\" Balag also decried that his \"constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy of communication and correspondence\" was violated due to the screenshots. During the Senate's hearing on Castillo's case, MPD's  Supt. Joel Coronel showed two threads of Facebook conversations among the Aegis Juris Fraternity members and some alumni discussing how to proceed with the death of Castillo. He added that the screenshots were already being authenticated by the authorities. Coronel said the conversations prove that the members intended to evade prosecution. The fratman also cited the same defense used by his co-respondents John Paul Solano and Alexander Hipe in their earlier filed counter-affidavit. Balag insisted that the medico-legal report stated that Castillo died with \"grossly normal\" kidney, which meant that the injuries he might have sustained due to hazing did not kill him. \"Simply put, there is no finding in any manner whatsoever that [Castillo] suffered multiple organ failure which is the reported common cause of death from hazing. Thus, the most likely proximate cause of the death of [Castillo] is cardiac arrest because of HCM, and not due to hazing,\" his counter-affidavit reads. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, in a news conference last week, detailed the final grueling hours of Castillo in the hands of his would-be fraternity brothers. Citing the sworn affidavit of witness Mark Ventura, Aguirre said that Castillo was punched for about an hour until his arms were black and blue and swollen. It was also revealed that members of the fraternity took turns hitting Castillo with a paddle until he collapsed. Balag is currently detained at the Senate after Sen. Grace Poe moved to cite him in contempt for repeatedly refusing to answer her questions on whether he heads the fraternity.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Instead of targeting imaginary drug lords, President Rodrigo Duterte should investigate the drug smugglers supposedly living inside his household, Sen. Leila de Lima said on Monday. In a statement, De Lima said Duterte is not interested in catching real drug lords as he is “merely using his notorious drug war as a platform for vengeance against the political oppositions.” Duterte should investigate his son and son-in-law instead of going after fictitious drugs lords which include Sen. Franklin Drilon, former Interior and Local Government chief Mar Roxas and dismissed Iloilo Mayor Jed Mabilog, she said. “He should go after the real drug lords. In order to do this, Mr. Duterte does not even have to go that far. Apparently, the drug smugglers are living right inside his own household,” De Lima, who is detained for drug-related charges, said. Duterte’s son Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and son-in-law Manases Carpio were both tagged by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV as the individuals behind the alleged Davao Group. De Lima made the statement after Ricky Serenio, a self-confessed bagman of the so-called Berya drug cartel, claimed in an affidavit that Drilon and Roxas were protectors of slain suspected drug dealer Melvin Odicta Sr. Odicta reportedly controlled the narcotics trade in Iloilo City, according to Serenio in an affidavit he submitted to La Carlota City prosecutor’s office in Negros Occidental last October 18. READ: Drug suspect tags Drilon, Roxas as protectors In a statement Saturday, the Liberal Party decried anew the allegations linking the two stalwarts to the narcotics trade, saying the accusation was a ploy by the Duterte administration to hide its “own horror stories.” “The move to link several prominent Liberal Party members to illegal drugs is their attempt to cover their lack of governance, which requires hard work, facts, and truth,” the former ruling-party said in a statement. In a Facebook post, Roxas said he was shocked at the brazenness of his accuser to invent lies about him. “Sabi nga ng mga kids ngayon, petmalu ng imagination (As kids say nowadays, incredible imagination)!” Roxas, who was LP’s standard bearer in last year’s elections but lost to President Duterte, said. He added: “I don’t know nor have I any dealings with Serenio nor Odicta; as in zero.” READ: LP: Drilon-Roxas 'drug links' tactic of Duterte admin to conceal 'own horror stories', LP: Drug links aim to demonize party",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 6:33pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Tokyo should publicly call on the Philippine government to end its \"murderous\" campaign to eradicate illegal drugs while President Rodrigo Duterte is embarking on a three-day state visit in Japan which started on Sunday, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog, said that Duterte's visit to Japan would provide Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his government a \"fresh opportunity\" to end their \"long silence\" on Manila's war on drugs which rights groups said has claimed at least 12,000 lives, a figure disputed by Filipino officials. Abe should also urge Duterte to take steps to hold those responsible for these deaths accountable, according to Phelim Kine, the deputy director of the Asia division of HRW. \"While the United States and the European Parliament have publicly criticized the extrajudicial killings of more than 12,000 suspected drug users and dealers since Duterte took office 15 months ago, the Japanese government has adopted a wholly uncritical business-as-usual posture with the Philippine government,\" Kine said in a statement over the weekend. This is not the first time that HRW has called on Tokyo to be more critical of the government's campaign against narcotics. In February, HRW also criticized Japan for its \"business as usual\" stance on the abuses committed in Duterte's drug war. HRW contrasted this with the strong stand of the United States and the European Union against drug-related killings and human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by police and hooded vigilantes. The group said then that providing prestige and development assistance to the Philippines without insisting on protections for human rights was not just \"wasted opportunity\" but also an \"encouragement\" to the Duterte government. Kine said that Abe should recognize the \"human rights calamity\" that the tough-talking Duterte had inflicted on the Philippines, adding that this should be meted with a coordinated response from partners of the Philippines such as Japan which value human rights. Abe could do this, Kine said, by denouncing the anti-drug campaign, by supporting a United Nations-led investigations into the killings and publicly supporting only voluntary, community-based drug treatment services that adhere to international standards and principles of human rights. Japan has missed in the past opportunities to call out the Philippines for massive human rights abuses and killings committed as it pursues its anti-drug campaign. Kine said that this was on display when Abe pledged a five-year, $800 million assistance to the Philippines to promote economic and infrastructure development during the premier's state visit from January 12 to 13. A month later, Japan's Vice Minister of Defense for International Affairs Ro Manabe endorsed the country's chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 2017. \"Manabe offered this plum support without reference to the rampant extrajudicial executions,\" Kine said. The Japan International Cooperation Agency failed to ask the Philippine Department of Health for details on how it would spend $17 million in assistance for the upgrading of drug rehabilitation centers and enhancement of treatment protocols for drug dependents, according to Kine. Kine added that this could risk the money going to drug-rehabilitation approaches linked to \"serious human rights violations\" in other parts of Asia. Duterte's anti-drug campaign has faced stringent criticisms from local and international groups for the alleged human rights abuses authorities have committed in its wake. The president has recently issued an order transferring the lead authority to conduct the campaign from the Philippine National Police to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in an effort to squelch the denunciations.",

During the resumption of the hearing on Castillo's case on Monday, Atty. Paris Real manifested to Department of Justice prosecutors that a show cause order should be issued against members of the media for reporting the contents of Ventura's affidavit. A show cause order requires the parties to explain an incident to the court. The prosecutors said that Real, who represents respondent Bose, should file an official motion before the office of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II. Aguirre revealed in a news conference last Wednesday that Ventura, a fratman and respondent in the case, has applied for the DOJ's Witness Protection Program. During the news briefing, Aguirre narrated parts of Ventura's affidavit where the fratman detailed that Castillo's arms were punched until they were black and blue and swollen. Citing Ventura's affidavit, Aguirre said Castillo, Aegis Juris Fraternity's neophyte, was also paddled by the fratmen until he collapsed. The justice chief, in the same briefing, said he would give a copy of Ventura's affidavit to the media. On Thursday morning, radio network DzBB first reported the new names believed to be cited in Ventura's sworn statement. Several media agencies also posted the names and quotes from the affidavit. But on Friday, Aguirre issued a warning to members of the media for reporting parts of Ventura's affidavit. He cited Section 7 of the Republic Act No. 6981 for the Witness Protection Program. \"No information or documents given or submitted in support of an application for admission to the WPP shall be released except upon written order of the Department or the proper court,\" Aguirre said. \"Any copy of the Sinumpaang Salaysay obtained by anyone and released publicly is a clear violation of the law and will be dealt with accordingly,\" the statement further reads. READ: Punched until swollen then paddled: Fratman recounts Atio's fatal hazing Aguirre also said Ventura might be removed from the list of respondents in the case that now has implicated at least 37 names. The justice chief cited that rules of the DOJ's program hold that \"to be qualified under the WPP, you should not appear to be the most guilty.\" The prosecutors, on Monday, however, said that Ventura remains a respondent in the case. The panel manifested that it has yet to receive a copy of Ventura's affidavit that he executed as part of the requirements in applying for the government protection. University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law Dean Nilo Divina, among the respondents of the case, appeared before the panel of prosecutors earlier to file his counter-affidavit. The dean said he was tagged in the case to forward the \"personal agenda\" of Lorna Kapunan, counsel of the Castillo couple. Divina also asked the DOJ to drop the complaints against him. The case stemmed from the murder, anti-hazing, robbery and obstruction of justice complaints filed by the Manila Police District and the Castillo couple against several members of the Aegis Juris Fraternity.",

Harry Roque as the president’s new mouthpiece. “It is clear that the president has very sure instincts and that PS (Presidential Spokesperson) Roque meets his expectations,” Abella said in a statement.  He added: “I believe PSR will be more than adequate for the occasion and will deliver the right support needed for PRRD’s program of government.” During the press briefing before departing for Tokyo Sunday night, President Rodrigo Duterte was tight-lipped on the reason behind Roque’s appointment. “The reason is my personal decision.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Dangerous Drugs Board wants to change the \"narrative\" surrounding the government's war on drugs by launching the \"Love Life. Fight Drugs\" campaign. DDB Chairman Dionisio Santiago on Monday said the board is gearing up for the launch of its new campaign \"Love Life. Fight Drugs\" that would focus on the government's \"left-hand approach\" in its crackdown on illegal drugs. \"The fight against drugs is about protecting the life of the people. It is about the life of a drug user who needs help to free himself or herself from drug independence. It is about protecting the life of people against the threats of drugs,\" Santiago said. President Rodrigo Duterte won the presidency May last year with the promise to ruthlessly rid the country of drugs and criminality. Roughly 16 months into the government's bloody war, the Philippine National Police has recorded more than 3,000 deaths under investigation, but human rights groups tally the deaths at more than 13,000. Criticism of the government's crackdown on drugs, which has subsided over the past months, reignited with the death of three teenagers, including 17-year-old Kian Delos Santos, in August. United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard called Delos Santos' death as a turning point in Duterte's drug war. Santiago said the board would also focus on a \"left-hand approach\" such as \"preventive education, advocacy and civic awareness programs that aim to prevent people from abusing drugs and enlist their participation in the anti-drug campaign.\" The board would also \"facilitate capacity-building of organic and related personnel involved in the enforcement of drug laws and prosecution of drug cases, and rehabilitation of drug offenders and their reintegration into mainstream society.\" It would also tap the help of the private sector to launch national and local community drug abuse prevention control programs and projects. The new campaign would be launch in November, in time for the celebration of the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Week. The board would also hold a fun run, an anti-drug fair and exhibit, an anti-drug concert and livelihood and skills training programs.",

Maquidato’s nephew, Rex Mer Solitario, posted online about his uncle’s death. “Naghahanap-buhay nang maayos, pinatay niyo. Hindi [na] kayo naawa sa tao at sa pamilya niya. Apat ang anak niya, maliliit pa sila. Maaga niyong kinuha sa kanila ang papa nila (He is working decently but you killed him. You didn’t even pity him and his family. He has four children. You took their father’s life too soon),” Solitario said on Facebook. Maquidato went viral August last year for helping a passenger undergoing dialysis. A certain Divine Lacto Ornum booked a GrabCar for her sister, Prima, who was on her way to Quezon City to pick up bags of blood for her dialysis. Maquidato picked her up but did not charge his passenger out of kindness. Grab Philippines said Prima has passed away but her relatives had the chance to thank Maquidato in person during his awarding.

The couple, in their supplemental complaint, hit Divina for issuing a blanket suspension to the members of the fraternity that “effectively allowed Respondent-Members to escape undetected and unscathed, and at the very least, to avoid being directly [questioned] by the MPD (Manila Police District) on Atio’s death.” “Such suspension order effectively prevented members of Aegis Juris to come forward with information to assist in the investigation,” the Castillo couple added. But Divina stressed that he has distanced himself from the fraternity since he assumed deanship of the Faculty of Civil Law in 2009. READ: 'Atio's family manipulated by lawyer' Divina said that noon of Sunday, September 17, he was informed by UST Faculty of Civil Law Secretary Arthur Capili—his co-respondent in the case—of \"an unconfirmed reported that an unnamed neophyte of the Aegis Juris Fraternity had died.\" At six in the evening of the same day, he was only informed of the victim's \"purported\" surname Castillo without a first name and detail of the alleged hazing. He once again instructed Capili to obtain more information on the case. \"Given the gravity of the offense that may have been committed from what appears to be a hazing activity, I then immediately placed all the student members of Aegis Juris fraternity under preventive suspension to ensure 'unobstructed investigation,'\" Divina stressed. The UST law dean also said that he has personally reached out to Chief Superintendent Joel Coronel,  Manila Police District chief, to express that the Faculty of Civil Law will \"implement whatever measures you think is necessary to assist the police in its investigation.\" He pointed out that the MPD, the public complainants in the case, \"did not see any basis to include me as respondent.\" The DOJ is set to hold a hearing on Castillo's case on Monday afternoon.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines - The Commission on Audit has identified the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office as a government-controlled corporation with the highest unauthorized allowances and bonuses granted to its officials and employees in 2016 amounting P518.314 million. In its 2016 Annual Financial Report on GOCCs released on October 26, the state audit body identified eight state firms, including the PCSO, to have granted perks to its officials and employees without “sufficient legal basis” totaling P619.771 million. Next to PCSO on the list was the Small Business Corp. with P46.448 million unauthorized allowances and bonuses granted in 2016. In its 2016 Annual Financial Report on GOCCs released on October 26, the state audit body identified eight state firms, including the PCSO, to have granted perks to its officials and employees without “sufficient legal basis” totaling P619.771 million. Infographics by Jonathan Asuncion. The SBC is an attached agency of the Department of Trade and Industry mandated to provide technical and financial assistance to small and medium entrepreneurs. The third identified erring GOCC was the National Electrification Administration with P23.683 million of unauthorized allowances and bonuses. The other state firms identified in the COA report to have granted perks without legal basis were the Philippine Coconut Authority (P11.475 million), National Food Authority (P10.097 million), Apo Production Unit Inc. (P7.45 million), Human Settlements Development Corp. (P2.085 million) and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. or IBC-13 (P219,000). The Apo Production Unit (previously Asian Productivity Organization) is an attached agency of the Presidential Communications Operations Office, which handles the printing demands of several government agencies and offices such as the accountable forms and other high quality/high volume print materials. Based on the COA records, of the PCSO's P518.314-million grants to its officials and employees, P503.667 million was for “payments of allowances, bonuses, and other benefits that were not supported by sufficient legal basis”, while the balance of P14.647 million “pertains to payments of allowances that were in excess of prescribed rates.” The state auditors said the allowances and other perks were given despite the gaming firm's unsettled disallowances from the previous years totaling P1.213 billion, which also stemmed from infractions of government compensation rules. Based on the COA report, the PCSO's 2016 pay package to its officials and employees includes the following: Christmas bonus (P151.174 million), educational assistance bonus (P123.817 million), grocery bonus (P71.08 million), weekly draw allowance (P60.267 million), hazard pay given to non-public health workers (P27.535 million), revenue performance incentive pay (P23.222 million) and some smaller amounts of allowances and anniversary bonus. The COA directed the PCSO and the other identified erring GOCCs to secure an approval from the Office of the President or the Government Commission on GOCCs (GCG) regarding their questioned compensation grants. The audit body also directed the GOCCs to “submit justification as to why the payment of incentives should not be disallowed in audit” and “to discontinue/stop the payment of compensation/allowances/benefits/incentives in the absence of legal basis/authority to grant the same.”",

He added: “I suppose that I have to limit my mouth there, except maybe to bring the warm greetings of the Filipino nation, a grateful nation to Japan as a matter of fact.” READ: Duterte set to meet Japanese imperial couple Duterte, who is known for his trademark cussing and free-wheeling use of language, is often criticized for remarks that critics say are “unpresidential.” The chief executive said he intended to meet Emperor Akihito before the latter steps down. “It’s a kind of homage to the emperor before he abdicates. The last time, I was not able to do it because his uncle died. That’s why I have to go back again,” he said. Duterte is scheduled to meet the respected Japanese royals on Tuesday before he returns to the country. He was supposed to meet the imperial couple during his first visit to Japan last year, but it was called off following the death of the emperor’s uncle Prince Mikasa. Duterte will also meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe—whom the president called as a “true friend” of Filipinos—to discuss issues like the North Korea threat, rebuilding of Marawi, terrorism and infrastructure projects.  READ: Duterte calls off courtesy call on Japanese Emperor Akihito At the same event, Duterte said he would deal with US President Donald Trump in the “most righteous way” during their bilateral meeting in November. “I will deal with President Trump in the most righteous way, welcome him as an important leader. As a matter of fact, [he is] the most important leader on the side of the planet,” he said. Duterte noted that he and the American leader “move their mouths in the same cadence.” “I will also have to listen to him to what he has to say. My responses would be calibrated on what he would ask,” he said. Duterte also said that the most important matter he would tackle with Trump is the issue on North Korea. Trump will be in Manila from November 12 to 13 to attend the special gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of ASEAN and the ASEAN-US Summit. The US president, however, will not be attending the East Asia Summit on Nov. 14 as he will be leaving the night before.

If signed by both houses of Congress, a PO1 will enjoy a 100-percent increase in monthly base pay from P14,834 pesos to P29,668. Before Dela Rosa made an informal announcement of a possible presidential bid, he advised Vice President Leni Robredo, who has repeatedly denied wanting to become president, to set aside her ambition and instead support President Rodrigo Duterte. \"If she wants to be president, she can try but she should let the current administration and the president finish the job,\" the police chief previously said in Filipino.  — Patricia Lourdes Viray RELATED: 100% pay hike for soldiers, cops in 2018",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Families affected by drug-related killings have expressed their support for the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines’s campaign “Stop the Killings! Start the Healing” slated to be launched on November 5. The kin of drug war victims and Rise Up for Rights and for Life, an alliance of human rights advocates, has in the past taken action to mobilize poor families affected by the government's anti-illegal drug campaign. “We wholeheartedly support broad and dynamic efforts to Stop the Killings and Start the Healing,” Rise Up said in a statement. “These killings must be stopped. Families affected by drug-related killings under the Duterte administration can feel in the depths of their beings the pain of having a loved one ripped from this earth. They know more than anyone how crucial it is to stop the killings,” it added. The organization cited that families affected by drug-related killings “have endured months of isolation and have even faced a stigma of being labeled as criminals, hustlers, and generally unredeemable burdens on society.” “Duterte’s attacks against the poor have continued to fuel unfair and nasty public disdain.  Our experience bears out that the families affected by drug-related killings are as diverse and as human as any.  Their desire to be embraced with compassion is real,” the organization explained. Rise Up and the families of drug war victims will join gatherings with other families and communities to stand in them in their call to stop the killings. They will also attend a mass for the same purpose on October 31 at the San San Isidro Labrador Parish in Barangay Silangan, Quezon City.  The organization said the gatherings are essential as these are intended for families to grieve and remember their deceased loved ones especially during the All Saint’s and All Soul’s day. It added that the gatherings sought to send a message that the Church cares for them and also to make them feel that they are not alone. With the church’s campaign, the families and human rights advocate will insist that justice would be given to the slain, the salvaged and the orphaned. Rise Up also encouraged participation of each parish, local church, community, school, or organization in their call to end killings. It urged the communities to to discern how they can contribute to amplifying and strengthening their common call. “We seek to live out a noble goal to “Stop the Killings! Start the Healing!” Giving pause to recognize that under current circumstances, we should be loud, united, and firm in our call. We must start the healing.  However, when fresh blood continues to be spilled in the streets, wounds will remain open and difficult to heal,” Rise Up said. “We embrace the call that those plagued by addiction must be given venues to redeem their lives and heal their illness,” it added. Earlier, Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, who took the custody of the minor witness in Kian Delos Santos’ death, said the church is not meddling in politics. He said the Stop the Killings, Start the healing campaign even offer rehabilitation program for drug users. RELATED: Caloocan bishop takes custody of minor witness in Kian slay",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Harry Roque, a lawyer and party-list representative, has warned President Rodrigo Duterte's critics that he will \"throw hollow blocks\" at them once he is officially appointed presidential spokesperson. In a video posted on Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Margaux \"Mocha\" Uson's Facebook page Mocha Uson Blog, Roque said in Filipino that he will not allow disrespect of the president to go unanswered. \"If, in the past, you were able to throw stones without anyone hitting back, be warned that if you throw stones, I won't just throw stones but hollow blocks,\" he said. It is not true that those viewed critical of the president and his administration were allowed to do so without a response from the government. President Duterte himself has launched profanity-laced rants against the European Union, the United Nations, media companies and members of the political opposition. \"Just wait for the adobe and hollow blocks that I will throw at you,\" Roque warned in the same video where he also said he believes in allowing \"the marketplace of ideas\" to flourish. \"Stop throwing stones. If you want, just help the country with the many problems it is facing,\" he also said. Roque said that he has not had a negative experience with the press in the past and that he is hopeful \"that we will work together.\" He reminded the media, however, that he is a lawyer.  Duterte made the announcement of Roque’s appointment during a birthday party for the congressman in Davao City on Friday night. “The reason is my personal decision. I am not about to explain why I did it,” Duterte said before he left for Japan Sunday evening. Duterte is confident that Roque will be able to get his message across. “He’s very competent, able, lahat na. It’s in the messaging actually. We cannot speak with the same words altogether, but how he would convey would be most important. I trust that he’d be able to come up to the expectations,” the president said. According to the Official Gazette, the secretary and undersecretary of the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson \"speak on behalf of the president and are the primary sources of information regarding current issues and concerns related to the president.\" READ: Tough-talking Harry Roque now Duterte's spokesperson Roque will attend his first Cabinet meeting on November 6.

CenterLaw also represents victims of the government's campaign against illegal drugs in petitions filed at the Supreme Court.  Officials of Kabayan party-list removed Roque as their first nominee to the House of Representatives last January. Roque disputed the decision and stayed in office. Among the bases for Roque’s ouster was the November 2016 hearing at the House where he asked Ronnie Dayan, the driver and former lover of Sen. Leila de Lima, private details of their relationship. De Lima, a Duterte critic, is in detention over drug-related charges that she denies and says are motivated by politics.

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:01am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez has called on Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to personally appear before Congress so she can be given the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses in the impeachment complaint against her. Alvarez assured the chief magistrate of due process – provided she personally appears in the impeachment hearing. “She should appear because she is the accused. Otherwise, her right to cross-examine the witnesses would be waived. If she does not appear, her lawyers have no right to cross-examine the witnesses,“ Alvarez said over the weekend. Under the rules of procedure in impeachment proceedings, defense lawyers are not allowed to cross-examine witnesses, he said. Defense counsel Josa Deinla, one of the spokespersons for Sereno, insisted that lawyers have the right to cross-examine – as a matter of due process – the resource persons of the House committee on justice. “Not one citizen can be denied the due process of law in the country because this is emphasized in our Constitution,” Deinla said. He said they have filed a motion following the failure of the committee led by Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali to act on Sereno’s two letters – dated Sept. 28 and Oct. 3 – seeking the panel’s consent for defense lawyers to cross-examine the witnesses. Umali said his panel will continue the hearing on Sereno impeachment when Congress resumes session on Nov. 20 after the Philippines’ hosting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and related meetings. The original schedule for the hearing was on Nov. 13. Lawyer Lorenzo Gadon, the complainant in Sereno’s impeachment, earlier disclosed that about six magistrates of the 15-strong Supreme Court have expressed willingness to testify against the Chief Justice. Gadon, however, revealed a senior justice has taken the side of Sereno. “This senior justice asked the officers of organizations of judges and court employees to issue manifesto of support for her,” Gadon revealed to The STAR. “It appears that the camp of Sereno was able to convince this senior justice for support. We don’t know what kind of deal they had with this retiring justice who is said to have plans to run for elective post after retirement from judiciary,” he said. In the meeting with groups of judges and court employees, the magistrate cited judicial independence and asked them to issue the manifesto, a couple of days before the House of Representatives starts the hearing on the impeachment case on Nov.13. “If the justice is invoking judicial independence, why did he not do that during the impeachment of the late Chief Justice Renato Corona? We’ll just see if he’s successful and if the groups will indeed issue the manifesto,” Gadon said. Gadon did not name the magistrate, but several court insiders revealed it was Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco Jr. who recently met with judges and court employees. The STAR tried to get Velasco’s side but to no avail. Before the elections last year, the high court declared Velasco’s son Lord Allan as duly elected representative of Marinduque following their disqualification of his winning rival Regina Ongsiako-Reyes in the 2013 polls. Sereno voted in favor of Velasco’s petition for his son, Lord Allan, who is said to be close to President Duterte.    The 57-year-old Sereno, who was neither a prosecutor nor a judge or Court of Appeals justice, was a private lawyer when she was appointed SC justice by former president Benigno Aquino III in 2010. She was later appointed as chief magistrate, replacing her late predecessor Renato Corona, who was convicted by the Senate impeachment court in May 2012. Aquino’s original choice for chief justice was former justice secretary (and now senator) Leila de Lima, but since the Judicial and Bar Council refused to include her in its shortlist, Aquino chose Sereno – the youngest or most junior among the 15 justices.  Sereno carries the distinction of being the first female Chief Justice, the second youngest and probably the only chief magistrate whose term could span four administrations – from Aquino, Duterte and two others who will be elected in 2022 and 2028. But while Sereno was the “youngest” appointee then, it turned out that her former colleague at the UP College of Law, dean Marvic Leonen, surpassed that honor after Aquino appointed Leonen to the high tribunal in 2012 – at the age of 49. If Sereno finishes her term in 2030, it will be Leonen who will be taking over the SC helm. Prior to Sereno and Leonen’s appointment to the judiciary, former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was vilified for designating young lawyers to the SC, among them Corona and now senior Justice Antonio Carpio – who were both 52 years old in 2001. – With Edu Punay",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Senate has allocated P1 billion each for two Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) programs that seek to strengthen micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).  Sen. Loren Legarda, chair of the Senate finance committee, said P1 billion in the proposed P3.7-trillion national budget for 2018 was allocated for Pondo Para sa Pagbabago of the Small Business Corp. and another billion for the Shared Services Facilities (SSF) program of the DTI. As principal sponsor and author of Republic Act 9501 or the Magna Carta for MSMEs, she said the appropriation was meant to help expand and enhance the capabilities and competency of the sector in support of President Duterte’s program to boost economic growth. The first program, she pointed out, would boost the continuous development of MSMEs, while the second would enhance the SSF productivity and competitiveness.  In the P1-billion fund for SSF, at least P200 million will go to state colleges and universities that implement livelihood initiatives; at least P100 million for Schools of Living Traditions (SLTs), and P50 million for the MSMEs affected by the war in Marawi City. “Compared to larger enterprises, our MSMEs are more susceptible to changes in economy, which would also affect their capability to employ and expand. Government interventions should address these factors that contribute to the unemployment and underemployment within our working class, as well as poverty incidence among all Filipinos,” Legarda explained. A 2015 survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that 896,839 or 99.5 percent of the country’s 900,914 total establishments belong to MSMEs while only 0.5 percent or 4,075 are considered large enterprises. The same study found that MSMEs have generated 4,784,870 jobs in 2015 while the large enterprises generated only 2,981,819. This indicated that MSMEs contributed almost 61.6 percent of the total jobs generated by all types of business establishments that year. Of this percentage, at least 29.4 percent or 2,285,634 jobs were generated by micro enterprises, 25.3 percent or 1,968,452 by small enterprises, and 6.8 percent or 530,784 by medium enterprises. Meanwhile, Sen. Cynthia Villar has pushed for the strengthening and creation of more MSMEs in the agribusiness sector, seeing it as a strong driver of growth and generator of jobs. Villar, chair of the Senate committee on agriculture and food, said MSMEs account for about one-third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), as 50 percent of the group are involved in food and beverage businesses. “Thus, we want to teach and guide farmers and farm owners to engage in business and tap opportunities. We should also extend support through capacity-building strategies and make them more competent and competitive,” Villar said. The strategy, she said, works by educating and training farmers through affordable or free agri-related training seminars and courses, and by removing the barriers to their success and development.  She also cited the need to enhance their technical expertise, financial literacy and access to credit, aside from hastening the mechanization drive in the agricultural sector. At the recent 65th anniversary of the Agri-Trade Fair in Zamboanga del Sur, Villar told her audience that she has always been an advocate of entrepreneurship, believing that it is the key to economic freedom of Filipinos. Being an entrepreneur, Villar said she has been pushing for legislative measures to help small businessmen like the Magna Carta for Micro-Enterprises and Republic Act 9178 or the Barangay Micro Business Enterprises (BMBEs) Act when she was a congresswoman. “As we promote entrepreneurship and develop a new generation of entrepreneurs, we create MSMEs – a strong engine of growth in our country,” she said. She emphasized that agribusiness is one of the long-term solutions in growing the agricultural sector and helping Filipino farmers and fisherfolk. “They have the potential to become entrepreneurs. They can join the ranks of MSMEs,” Villar added.  ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) has called on UN member states and the international community to “act now” and ensure long-term measures to tackle natural disasters. “With devastating floods, hurricanes and earthquakes that have impacted numerous countries, humanitarian response must be complemented by medium and long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts,” the ECOSOC said in a statement issued by its president Marie Chatardová. “Early humanitarian response has been critical for saving lives and livelihoods and the provision of essential services,” Chatardová said following the council’s special meeting on the “Aftermath of recent hurricanes: Achieving a risk-informed and resilient 2030 Agenda” last week. She said preparedness and partnerships played an essential role in enabling the quick arrival of humanitarian response and emergency supplies during disaster. Chatardová also issued a statement expressing the council’s condolences to disaster victims and extending solidarity to all the affected people and governments in the hurricane-hit Caribbean, Central America, the United States and Mexico, which was struck by successive earthquakes as well as Africa and South Asia where severe floodings occured. ECOSOC has been assessing displacements and disruptions to livelihoods of people and their immediate needs such as health, water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and shelter. It called for greater investment in disaster risk reduction, including preparedness, early warning and early action and urged for greater risk-informed investment in infrastructure and housing. “We call for stronger collaboration, connectivity and complementarity between humanitarian, development, disaster risk reduction and climate action to define and deliver collective outcomes and to reduce need, risk and vulnerability over multiple years,” said the council. It said attention must be given to the most vulnerable people facing climate change and extreme weather events. Elaborating on the measures needed in both the medium and long term, the council called for longer term recovery, development and reconstruction programs, pointing to, among others, the regeneration of industries, including tourism, agriculture and fisheries. “More importantly, key industries and livelihoods must be made sustainable and resilient to the impacts of future extreme weather events and other hazards. We must support efforts of affected and vulnerable countries to diversify their economies and harness the benefits of digital economy to enhance their economic resilience,” the statement explained. “We need to act urgently,” council members said, adding that they are committed to continue to promote coordination of UN work in development and progress of countries.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police (PNP) will implement Oplan Kaluluwa nationwide on All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day to ensure peaceful and orderly observance of these special days. PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa advised the public not to leave their houses unattended or unsecured as akyat bahay burglars might have a field day.\n\tDela Rosa said although there may be some adjustments to ensure that security measures are appropriate, the PNP has prepared templates for tight security measures on Nov. 1 and 2. He also urged subdivision and barangay leaders to form defense forces and patrol teams to coordinate and ensure the security of their respective areas. Dela Rosa has approved the recommendation of National Capital Regional Police Office chief Director Oscar Albayalde to suspend the permit to carry firearms outside residence (PTCFOR) from Nov. 1 to 15 or from All Saints’ Day until the ASEAN summit. Albayalde said aside from Metro Manila, the suspension of PTCFOR covers the Central Luzon provinces of Aurora, Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija and Zambales. He said authorities are also monitoring alleged recruitment of militant groups to join protest actions during the ASEAN. He, however, said authorities have not monitored any specific threats during the special nonworking holidays. The PNP issued tips for those leaving their homes, inside the cemeteries or taking public transport. It said it would continue to implement police visibility, mobile patrols and checkpoints to deter crimes and other security threats to protect the public. The PNP gave people some reminders before leaving their homes: lock all doors and windows and ensure that all possible entrances to the house are blocked; install a burglar alarm to alert the neighbors if someone breaks in; do not leave notes outside the house indicating you will be away; keep some appliances like radio on to give the impression that someone is inside the house; ask a trusted neighbor to keep watch over your house while you are away; ensure no candle, gas stove, leaking faucet or plugged appliance is left unattended; and secure all items outside the house such as clothes being hung out to dry, bicycles or vehicles. When going inside cemeteries, police suggested the following: bring sufficient food and water; keep in mind that liquor and food sold by vendors inside cemeteries are prohibited; bring protection against heat and rain; do not bring deadly or bladed weapons, loudspeakers, and gambling paraphernalia; closely watch items brought inside cemeteries and make sure that lighted candles will not cause fires. Remind children not to roam around, especially in crowded areas and have them wear or bring some identification; keep surroundings clean and bring own trash bag to put garbage in; know where the first aid stations and PNP assistance booths are in case of emergency or the need for police assistance; and if attending a wake, make sure the area is crime-free. The PNP also urged the public to remember the BLOW BAGETS rule when traveling – battery, light, oil, water, brakes, air, gas, engine, tires and self. Police said vehicle owners should make sure doors are locked and windows closed, especially if children are on board and avoid driving when drunk or sleepy. The PNP also advised people taking public transport not to wear expensive jewelry or bring large amounts of money and watch their mobile phones.\n\t“If you see a suspicious package, or someone acting suspiciously, notify authorities. Be wary of snatchers and petty thieves and report incidents to the nearest police assistance post,” the PNP said in its advisory. – With Non Alquitran",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "LANAO DEL SUR  , Philippines  —   It all began here. Thousands of residents of Barangay Basak Malutlut where the bloody siege of Marawi began on May 23 have returned to their homes after being forced out by the fighting between government forces and Islamic militants for five months. Regional Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong, head of the Marawi Crisis Management\n\tCommittee, said authorities have allowed the return of the residents after the military declared some of the areas in Marawi City safe from booby traps and unexploded bombs, including Basak Malutlut. The village was the starting point of the Marawi siege where the first burst of gunfire from the Maute group erupted following the attempt of security forces to capture slain Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was then hiding in the city. More than 350,000 people from in and around Marawi were displaced because of the conflict, which ended on Oct. 23 when troops killed the remaining Maute gunmen inside a mosque. With the eastern half of Marawi almost totally destroyed and worries over bombs planted by the militants, authorities have said it could be months or even years before most people would be able to return. “Residents of Barangay Basak Malutlut started returning to their homes today, October 29. We are thankful to the office of Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra and all other agencies and cause-oriented groups helping return evacuees to Marawi City,” Adiong said. The military’s Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) and the regional police of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have allowed the return of evacuees to areas already inspected by bomb disposal teams. Initial reports estimated some 5,000 residents of Barangay Malutlut returned to what remained of their village. Local officials have to screen the evacuees to determine if they are residents of the barangay. On the other hand, bomb experts from the military and police are busy deactivating IEDs left by the terrorists and collecting unexploded bombs scattered in some critical areas of the city. “We cannot compromise the safety of the returning evacuees. We have to protect them from possible accidents,” Westmincom commander Lt. General Carlito Galvez Jr. said. About 10,000 Marawi residents have been allowed to return so far, mostly those who lived near Mindanao State University that was well outside the battle zone, according to local authorities. About 33,000 others, whose homes are in so-called “controlled areas” that were spared the worst of the war, are set to follow this week, officials said. Adiong said the Westmincom and the ARMM police have secured the safe return of the evacuees to their homes they abandoned. “We are also thankful to different government agencies and non-government cause-oriented groups helping these evacuees,” Adiong said. Many of the displaced are living with relatives and friends, but tens of thousands without support networks have been forced to live in makeshift evacuation centers. The five months of fighting claimed the lives of 920 militants, 165 soldiers and policemen and 47 civilians. Thousands of buildings were destroyed with entire districts turned into piles of concrete rubble. After the remaining Maute terrorists were wiped out, the government began the full blast reconstruction and rehabilitation of Marawi. Officials said the government has received assistance from Canada, China, Germany, Korea, India, Thailand, Singapore, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Management for the early recovery and rehabilitation efforts in Marawi City and other affected areas. Additional pledges came from Australia, Japan, the United States, European Union, Asian Development Bank, World Bank and United Nations Development Program. The United Nations Refugee Agency has engaged the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) to provide identification cards to the evacuees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said most of the evacuees lost their documents in their haste to flee their homes as the fighting broke out. Even with the liberation of Marawi and the termination of combat operations in the city, a “No ID, No Entry” policy in different checkpoints in the provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur remains implemented. The lack of documentation can also curtail the ability of the evacuees to avail themselves of government help. “Very important as the response transitions to early recovery and rehabilitation for the displaced population to have identity documents so they can readily avail of durable solutions after displacement,” said Yasser Saad, UNHCR head in the Philippines. To mitigate these protection risks, the PhilHealth ID will serve as documents proving the identity of the evacuees and address restrictions to their mobility, Saad said. Lawmakers, on the other hand, urged the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to immediately issue the proper guidelines for the implementation of tax-free balikbayan boxes for overseas Filipino workers and help in delivering assistance to residents of Marawi City. This came after BOC Commissioner Isidro Lapeña suspended the rules on balikbayan boxes. Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto and Sen. Sonny Angara said the BOC must come out soon with the guidelines as the Christmas season approaches and kind-hearted OFWs want to send donations to Marawi evacuees. Vice President Leni Robredo, for her part, is readying the assistance program for the rehabilitation of Marawi City through her office’s flagship anti-poverty program, Angat Buhay. She said the Office of the Vice President has been assisting Marawi women even before the 153-day clashes began. During the siege, the OVP extended assistance to displaced residents. Robredo is set to visit Marawi in the coming weeks to personally check the condition of affected communities. Robredo called on Filipinos to honor those who sacrificed their lives during the five-month battle with the Maute extremists. She asked for prayers for the fallen soldiers and their families, who also made sacrifices to keep the country safe. “Let’s offer prayers to our soldiers who laid down their lives to achieve peace in Marawi,” Robredo said. “Let’s use this opportunity to thank our soldiers not just those who fought in Marawi but also those in Basilan, Sulu and other parts of the Philippines,” she added. –Pia Lee-Brago, Paolo Romero, Helen Flores",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Programs of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the Philippines are neither conditional nor are they affected by concerns over human rights issues. “We have a long history of providing very significant foreign assistance to the Philippines,” US Ambassador Sung Kim said at a forum of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines on Thursday. However, Kim said the weapons provided to the Philippine National Police (PNP) by the US hinge on Washington’s concerns over human rights. “What has been affected by our concerns over human rights issues is that we have been much more cautious about providing lethal weapons to the Philippine National Police, elements that are directly involved in the anti-drugs campaign,” he said. But the ambassador said the US has continued to provide assistance to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in terms of training, equipment and sharing intelligence. President Duterte had ordered the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to take the lead in the administration’s anti-drug campaign. Duterte also directed the PNP, AFP, National Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Customs, Philippine Postal Corp. and all other agencies to refrain from spearheading drug operations to avoid conflict. In January, the USAID said it did not have the resources for funding drug rehabilitation in the Philippines but remained open to discussion for support to the President’s priority program. Senior deputy assistant administrator for Asia Gloria Steele said the agency understands that rehabilitation is a priority of Duterte’s war on drugs. “They just said that’s an area they want to talk to us about but we don’t have resources,” Steele said.",

The Third Quarter Social Weather Survey, conducted from Sept. 23-27, showed 54 percent of Filipinos aged 18 years and above who agreed with the statement, “Hindi pinapatay ang mga mayayaman na drug pusher; ang mga pinapatay ay ang mahihirap lamang (Rich drug pushers are not killed; only the poor ones are killed).” The other 25 percent disagreed while 21 percent were undecided. This resulted in a net agreement score of “moderately strong” +29, eight points below and and one grade down from the “very strong” +37 in June. Net agreement that only poor drug pushers are killed was highest in Metro Manila at very strong +49 (70 percent agree, 21 percent disagree). This was 12 points lower and one grade down from the extremely strong +61 (75 percent agree, 14 percent disagree) in June. It stayed very strong in balance Luzon at +37 (58 percent agree, 21 percent disagree), up by three points from +34 (58 percent agree, 24 percent disagree). It rose by one grade from moderately strong to very strong in the Visayas at +31 (56 percent disagree, 26 percent disagree), up by 10 points from +21 (53 percent agree, 32 percent disagree). Net agreement that only the poor drug pushers are killed was lowest in Mindanao at a neutral -1 (34 percent agree, 35 percent disagree).

            "content": "ILOILO CITY  , Philippines  —  The camp of Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog is seeking to stop the implementation of the Office of the Ombudsman’s dismissal order against him while it is under appeal. Department of the Interior and Local Government officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy said he had sent a directive to their regional director in Western Visayas to implement the dismissal order against Mabilog this week. Mabilog’s legal counsel Joenar Pueblo, citing Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, said he would file today or on Nov. 2 a petition before the Court of\n\tAppeals seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the mayor’s dismissal. “But if they (DILG) can’t be stopped, we couldn’t do anything about it. What we are asking is for them to wait until we could file a petition for a TRO,” Pueblo said. Pueblo said they would just contest the dismissal order before the court. Mabilog went on leave last September and had reportedly gone abroad after being linked to drugs by President Duterte. The ombudsman ordered him dismissed for “serious dishonesty” in connection with his “unlawful acquisition of wealth.” Cuy said Mabilog does not have to be physically present for the dismissal order to take effect. On the contrary, Pueblo expressed the belief that the dismissal order should be served personally. If the person is not there to personally receive it, then it should go through publication, he added. “Obviously, we have no power to receive it. It’s a specific order and we have no authority to receive it,” Pueblo said. If and when the DILG would serve the order, Pueblo, speaking on a personal capacity, believed there would be no violence that would spring from Mabilog’s allies and supporters. “Knowing Mayor Mabilog, he’s not someone who would cling on to his post,” he added.",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Aegis Juris fraternity member Marc Anthony Ventura will soon be dropped from the list of suspects in the fatal hazing of University of Santo Tomas (UST) law freshman student Horacio Castillo III, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said yesterday. At least 37 individuals were charged with murder, hazing and obstruction of justice by Castillo’s parents and the Manila Police District. But Aguirre explained that Ventura, after submitting a tell-all affidavit to the Department of Justice (DOJ) last week, would consequently be delisted from among those charged. Ventura, who named at least 23 frat brothers involved in Castillo’s initiation rites at the Aegis Juris library last Sept. 17, was also given full coverage under the witness protection program (WPP). The justice chief said the DOJ has found Ventura a credible witness. “For you to be qualified under WPP, you should not appear to be the most guilty. And he is not the most guilty upon our assessment. We saw that it (testimony) was very voluntary on his part. He said he’s ready to face the consequences of his decision with respect to his membership in the fraternity. He’s willing to be expelled,” Aguirre explained. He added that since Ventura is the only witness they have at this time, his testimony is necessary to successfully prosecute the cases against those responsible for Castillo’s death. “We don’t know if there will be more witnesses. But, even if we only have him, his testimony is already strong enough,” Aguirre said. In his affidavit, Ventura named 23 fraternity members present during the initiation rites. He also gave nine new names: Edric Pilapil, Zach Abulencia, Daniel Ragos, Dave Felix, Sam Cagalingan, Alex Cairo, Luis Kapulong, Kim Cyrill Roque and Ged Villanueva. He also confirmed the participation of their fraternity president Arvin Balag, master initiator Axel Munro Hipe and 12 other members already charged before the DOJ – Ralph Trangia, Oliver John Audrey Onofre, Mhin Wei Chan, Daniel Hans Matthew Rodrigo, Karl Matthew Villanueva, Joshua Joriel Macabali, Marcelino Bagtang, Zimon Padro, Jose Miguel Salamat, Leo Lalusis, Alex Bose and Robin Ramos. According to him, the initiation started at 2 a.m. with a prayer so that nothing untoward would happen during the rites. Castillo was then asked to do some stretching exercises before frat members started punching his arms. Ventura added that they used spatulas in tapping Castillo’s arms to reduce the swelling and calm the muscles, before hitting him with paddles. After the third paddle hit, the initiators asked Castillo if he could still endure the process to which he answered yes. After the fourth hit at around 5 a.m., the neophyte collapsed. Ventura said in his affidavit that they then decided to summon John Paul Solano, a member who has medical background, to help revive Castillo. He added that they already carried Castillo to a vehicle to bring him to a hospital when Solano arrived, prompting them to bring him back to the library where Solano attempted to revive the unconscious victim. It was only after Solano’s failure that the group allegedly decided to bring him to the Chinese General Hospital, instead of the nearby UST hospital, where Castillo was declared dead.   Sen. Joel Villanueva urged Ventura to remain strong, believing that other fraternity members are harassing and “ganging up on him.” Villanueva, a UST alumnus, believes that the whole university community was disgusted with the killing, which did not reflect “Thomasian spirit and values.”  Sen. Panfilo Lacson said the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, which he heads, would hold its final hearing on Nov. 6 and would summon anew all the suspects.  Aguirre will also be invited as the panel prepares to draft amendments to Republic Act 8049 or the Anti-Hazing Law. Lacson said there is a need to formally enter Ventura’s testimony into the Senate records. During the last hearing, nearly all suspects, expect Solano, invoked their right against self-incrimination. Balag was also cited for contempt and remains detained at the Senate for abusing this right.             – With Paolo Romero",

            "timestamp": "October 30, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "CLARK FREEPORT, Pampanga  , Philippines  —   Authorities securing the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been alerted against possible “lightning strikes” by militant groups along the routes of leaders and delegates attending the summit next month. Pampanga police operations chief Supt. Michael John Riego said militant groups protesting the holding of the summit could block or flash protest signs along the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (SCTEX) and North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) where the leaders and delegates are expected to pass through. Riego said groups staging lightning strikes could be arrested. Lightning strikes could occur even as officials said the SCTEX or the NLEX would be closed to other motorists during ASEAN convoys.   “NLEX people did not want it probably because there would be heavy losses, so what will be implemented is a stop-and-go scheme to give way to the convoys,” Riego said. Riego said heavy traffic caused by the recent dry runs for the ASEAN event was due to “miscommunication.” He said gaps in the dry runs had been patched up and the stop-and-go scheme was minimized to allow motorists only five to 10 minutes of delay. Riego stressed the traffic interventions would only be implemented during the arrival and departure of leaders and delegates attending the event. “The heads of states would be flown from Clark airport to Manila destinations. The rest would be escorted in convoys by land,” he said. Interior and Local Government officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy, chairman of the ASEAN committee on security, appealed to the motoring public to take other routes and refrain from passing through the NLEX and EDSA during summit days. He said the two major highways would be used in the stop-and-go scheme whenever a delegate passes through. Cuy spelled out the lockdown schedules and the affected ASEAN lanes. “With less that two weeks before the event, I urge the public to steer clear of said lockdown areas so that they will not be trapped just in case there is a passing convoy,” he said. The affected areas include: the CCP complex in Pasay City where a partial lockdown would be implemented on Nov. 8 from 12:01 a.m. onwards; the SMX-MAAX Block, also in Pasay City on a complete lockdown on Nov. 11 from 10 p.m. onwards; on Nov. 12, there will be a complete lockdown of the CCP complex from 12:01 a.m. onwards; on Nov. 13, a total lockdown of Roxas Boulevard starting from Padre Burgos Ave. to Buendia Avenue will be implemented from 12:01 a.m. onwards; there will be a partial lifting of the lockdown at the SMX-MAAX Block on the same date from 12:01 a.m. onwards; at noon there will be lifting of lockdown for Roxas Boulevard (from Padre Burgos street to Buendia Avenue) on the same date. On Nov. 14, there would be a continuous lockdown of CCP complex; on Nov. 15 (noon onwards), a partial lifting of lockdown for CCP complex. During partial lockdown period, Cuy said pedestrians and vehicles without ASEAN IDs and decals are allowed to enter the above-mentioned routes provided that they pass through the vehicle and pedestrian security areas. “On days with full lockdown schedule, only pedestrians and vehicles with ASEAN IDs and decals will be allowed to pass while the general public will be denied access to these routes,” Cuy said. Riego added the Clark International Airport could accommodate a maximum of four 747 jumbo jets while others are to be directed to the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City. Security arrangements have been made to accommodate the flights of ASEAN delegates to Clark International Airport. Officials said this was decided so as not to disrupt flights at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila. Malacañang had declared Nov. 13 and 14 as non-working days in Pampanga, Bulacan and the National Capital Region in relation to the ASEAN events being hosted by the Philippines. A total of 22 foreign leaders and more or less 3,000 delegates will attend the 31st ASEAN Summit here. Among the world leaders attending the summit are US President Donald Trump, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. A task group led by Cuy has been formed to implement security plans during the ASEAN Summit. A total of 33,086 policemen will be deployed during the event. Cuy urged local chief executives of Metro Manila and Region III to provide support to the ASEAN delegates; remove unwanted elements on the streets that will create more traffic; and display information, education and communication materials that express support for the ASEAN. – With Cecille Suerte Felipe",

Reports said Quedan posed new dangers a week after Typhoon Paolo (Lan) caused widespread flooding, travel disruptions and at least seven deaths in Japan. Malacañang said the President’s flight was delayed to ensure it is safe from the onslaught of the storm. The President is expected to return here at around 9 p.m. tomorrow in time for the All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day commemoration.  While in Tokyo, the Palace said Duterte will have a series of meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and seek an audience with Japanese Emperor Akihito and other government officials.  The President will also be meeting with top Japanese businessmen in an effort to entice more investments for the country, particularly in infrastructure. Duterte and Abe are expected to discuss the North Korea issue as well as the Marawi City rehabilitation which has to be undertaken immediately. Duterte and Abe will also discuss, aside from bilateral issues in the economic, industrial, social and security arena, regional development issues including peace and stability. The President is meeting Abe prior to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit and related meetings in Manila next month. The two will also meet in Vietnam next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.  Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea has been designated as government caretaker while the President is abroad.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — To speak and not to advise.   Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman of the opposition reminded his former colleague in the House of Representatives, now Malacañang spokesman Harry Roque, that his role is to speak for President Duterte and not to serve as an adviser.   “The presidential spokesman is the President’s mouthpiece, not his volunteer adviser on human rights and other policy concerns,” Lagman said, noting that “Roque is expanding his turf even before he officially assumes office.”   Lagman issued the statement after learning from Roque’s press statement that he “accepted the position of spokesman in order to advise the President on human rights issues.” “By accepting this position, I am not condoning the violence surrounding the government’s anti-drug campaign, nor do I intend to further the same. Regardless of whether I am a member of Congress or of the President’s Cabinet, I continue to value the right to life and dignity of every person and do not support the arbitrary killing of any person by the state,” Roque also said in his statement. Lagman said advising the President on human rights issues “is the jurisdiction of the secretary of justice” and not of Roque.    “The role of a spokesman is to incant, elaborate or moderate the President’s pronouncements, not to mold the Chief Executive’s statements beforehand. A spokesman reports the President’s statements but does not advise his principal on what to say,” he said.  “One cannot be a spokesman and an adviser at the same time because an advice may not be heeded, and such rejection or contrary opinion of the President must be articulated by the spokesman,” Lagman added.   Roque’s former colleague in the party-list coalition in the House, on the other hand, lauded Duterte’s “good choice” of Roque. “His wealth of experience on human rights law, international law, and constitutional law will serve him well in his new post,” Rep. Bernadette Herrera-Dy said.   “He is well-liked by the news media. He knows what they need. He knows what to say to the media. He understands the work the news media do. These qualities make him certainly qualified to field questions from the press and clarify the issues,” she said.  Dy represents party-list Bagong Henerasyon in the House while Roque used to be with Kabayan.   “Harry is also a man who likes and practices order and sense, which are badly needed now at Malacañang where some of the most bewildering and bothersome mysteries have been unfolding as how the Palace is using the many powerful communication tools and agencies at their disposal,” she said.  Duterte announced the appointment of Roque in Davao City on Friday night. Roque will replace Ernesto Abella, who will reportedly be transferred to another government agency. The President said Roque should be able to convey to the Filipinos exactly what he wants to tell them.",

Angela Lavadia, Philippine Dermatological Society president, said there are new medications and intervention available for psoriasis, a non-infectious skin disease marked by red, itchy and scaly patches, but patients are not aware of it. “About two percent of the country’s population are affected by psoriasis, but are afraid to come out and seek treatment,” Lavadia added.         She said psoriasis patients should seek immediate treatment, which would depend on the extent and severity of condition. Patients may be given topical treatments, like cream, or tablets to drink.       Lavadia added that her group is pushing Congress to pass a law providing free treatment for patients and to have it covered by PhilHealth. Josef de Guzman, Psoriasis Philippines president, said psoriasis patients usually isolate themselves for fear of getting discriminated.         “There are so many things that psoriasis patients like me wanted to enjoy, but the society prevents us from doing it,” De Guzman said.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Eddie Villanueva, founder of the Jesus Is Lord Church, has joined calls against extrajudicial killings in the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. During the 39th anniversary of Jesus is Lord (JIL) Church held at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila last Friday, Villanueva assured President Duterte of support to the government’s efforts to combat illegal drugs, but stressed that the killing of drug suspects violates God’s sixth commandment – thou shall not kill. “We support the resolve of President Duterte to get rid of the drug menace in the country. But we would also like to remind everyone of the 6th commandment – Thou shall not kill. No one has the right to take another person’s life,” Villanueva said in a press briefing. He said the drive to rid the country of the drug menace should not be done at the expense of due process. The church leader reminded Duterte, whom he supported in last year’s presidential election, of his campaign promise to uphold God’s agenda for the country should he win the presidency and of his inaugural speech where he said the “adherence to due process and rule of law is non-compromising.” “I believe the President when he said before the European Union that he never ordered these extrajudicial killings. So I would like to call on our law enforcers not to embarrass our President,” Villanueva appealed. He also cited the economic impacts, especially in terms of downtrend in foreign direct investments, of the killings. “As of Oct. 27, the dollar to peso exchange rate is at P51.80. When PRRD started on July 1, 2016, the US dollar to peso rate was at P47.001. For those who understand economics, this is very alarming,” Villanueva added. Leaders of Christian churches in the country, including the Philippines for Jesus Movement (PJM) and the Philippine Council of Evangelical Churches (PCEC), also joined Villanueva in making calls against killing suspected illegal drug traders, pushers and users. They also expressed grave concern on the alleged involvement of high-ranking government officials in the trafficking of drugs.   According to the Philippine National Police, over 3,800 suspects have been killed in police operations. But the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA) contested this, claiming the number should be at least 12,000.                       – With Rey Galupo    ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Newly installed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Lt. Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero has received his marching orders from President Duterte to put an end to remaining threats on peace and security in the country. AFP Public Affairs Office chief Col. Edgard Arevalo said Guerrero has the experience to carry out that task given to him by the commander-in-chief. “Lt. Gen. Guerrero welcomes his new responsibilities with strong momentum from his leadership of the Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom), a similarly tall order given the area’s susceptibility from terror threats and insurgency,” Arevalo said yesterday. Guerrero served as commander of the Eastmincom, which is at the forefront in the fight against the communist New People’s Army (NPA) in Northern Mindanao. Duterte also tasked Guerrero to “sweep” any traces of the Maute rebellion in Marawi City and contain the spread of extremism. “The priorities in the area of peace and security are clear: finish the remaining terrorist groups, neutralize the communist insurgency threat, and support law enforcement against lawless armed groups,” Guerrero said in his assumption speech during the change of command ceremony held in Camp Aguinaldo last week. Arevalo said the turnover was held less than a week from the termination of combat operations in Marawi City and takes off strong with gains against the Abu Sayyaf, characterized by numerous surrenders. Guerrero added the AFP must continue with its reform programs, improve capability, and revisit war-fighting doctrines in light of new “battlefield environments.” “We will aggressively implement our modernization program and fast-track the procurement of advance weapons systems that provide cost-effective and precise target engagement, long-range and high-endurance unmanned systems, and modern air and naval platforms,” he said. The new military chief said he also seeks to refine internal processes including improvements on services and transparency and accountability of transactions. “My gratitude knows no bounds, and I think that the best way to show our President and our countrymen is to serve our country with selfless dedication and to lead the AFP with purpose,” Guerrero said.",

DILG officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy, who is also the concurrent chairperson of the ASEAN Committee on Security, Peace and Order, Emergency Preparedness and Response (CSPOEPR), sought for the public’s understanding amid the scheduled lockdown and road closures. \"With less than two weeks before the event, I urge the public to steer clear of said lockdown areas so that they will not be trapped just in case there is a passing a convoy,\" Cuy said. Cuy also advised motorists and land travelers to refrain from passing through the North Luzon Expressway and EDSA as a stop and go scheme would be implemented every time an ASEAN convoy passes through these two major highways. The DILG said pedestrians and vehicles without ASEAN IDs and decals would be allowed to enter the ASEAN routes provided that they pass through the vehicle and pedestrian security areas. On days with full lockdown schedule, however, only pedestrians and vehicles with ASEAN IDs and decals would be allowed to pass while the general public would be denied access to these routes.   Cuy also asked the local chief executives of Metro Manila and Central Luzon (Region III) to provide support to the delegates. He requested the local government units to remove unwanted elements on the streets that would create more traffic and display information, education and communication materials that express support for ASEAN. The acting DILG chief thanked LGUs that responded to the logistical needs of the ASEAN Summit.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte’s biggest election campaign donor, Davao del Norte Rep. Antonio Floirendo Jr., yesterday decried his sudden expulsion from the ruling party PDP-Laban. Floirendo denounced his erstwhile party for its “immediate termination” of his membership “without due process” and without even hearing his side. He said the letter of termination “cited three violations which were attributed to me without asking in writing for my side on the issues.” “Worse, they imputed on me certain partisan activities I did not even have a clue whatsoever, and accused me maliciously of disloyalty, sowing disunity and discord and using media to air my grievances,” Floirendo said in a statement. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, as national president of the party, led the signing of the letter of expulsion. Other signatories are Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez, as secretary-general of the party, and Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, as vice-chairman. In the letter of expulsion, Floirendo was charged with disloyalty to the party and its leaders, organizing and participating in an unauthorized and unsanctioned party convention thereby sowing disunity and discord within the party; and manifesting grievances to the public and media instead of settling internal disputes. This was contrary to the democratic, legal, moral and ethical principles and policies PDP-Laban founders have preached and stood for, Floirendo said. “It is also notable that one of its present leaders has resorted to fabrication of stories and lies just to advance his interest and his personal crusade against me and my family,” Floirendo added. “Already at the tail-end of numerous false allegations by this individual who had benefited avariciously from our family, my being accused of imagined transgressions violates accepted rules on impartiality, which is what the party has always fought for,” he said. Despite his expulsion, Floirendo said he would continue to support President Duterte, to whom he donated P75 million during the election campaign as reported to the Commission on Elections by the Chief Executive himself. “Despite this unstatesman-like demeanor of a few, let me just reiterate that my full support is still with our President and I shall keep within me the true ideals and virtues of PDP Laban,” Floirendo said. Floirendo did not name names, but he and Alvarez are embroiled in a bitter feud reportedly triggered by a spat between their girlfriends. He and his House boss were formerly close friends. He represents Davao del Norte’s second district while Alvarez is representative of the first district. Alvarez had filed a complaint for graft against his erstwhile buddy, accusing him of still having financial interest in Tagum Agricultural Development Corp. (Tadeco) while he was a member of the House of Representatives. The law prohibits such practice. Recently, the Office of the Ombudsman, where the Speaker filed his complaint, found probable cause to indict Floirendo, who claimed he had terminated his financial interest in the family-owned business. Upon the instance of Alvarez, the House of Representatives committee on good government has inquired into the renewal of Tadeco’s contract, which the Speaker said is grossly disadvantageous to the government. – With Jose Rodel Clapano  ",

Power, a former journalist and a professor of public policy, also cited as another “Trump effect in action” Myanmar leaders’ dismissing reports of killing and displacement of the Rohingya people as fabricated news.

            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte wants a United Nations list of illicit drugs distributed among schools nationwide as part of educating children on the serious effects of the chemicals in these illegal drugs on the mental and physical health of their users. “I will give you a copy. This is good for the children. It is called precursors. You just digest it, International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), precursors and chemicals frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,” the President said in remarks at the 25th anniversary celebration of the Center for Brighter Beginnings here at the Davao Convention Center Friday night. The INCB, which produced the list, is an independent and quasi-judicial control organ for the implementation of UN drug conventions. It is also involved in monitoring enforcement of restrictions on narcotics as well as in deciding which precursors should be regulated. “I’ll give a copy of this to every school. Andito na lahat. Ang (Everything is here, the) chemicals,” he said, as he read out details and risks from cannabis addiction. “Other risks – sinabi ‘yan about health… Other risks – cannabis smoke contains 50 percent tar, more than the high-tar cigarettes, which puts users at an increased risk of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases,” he pointed out. “Mixing cocaine with alcohol is a dangerous cocktail and can greatly increase the chances of sudden death,” he added. The President also talked about the dangers of Ecstasy pills, which he claimed also likely contain cocaine. “Bright, moderate tablet or pills that are sold as Ecstasy may contain other potentially dangerous substances and can vary in strength and effects; may contain cocaine,” the President said. He also spelled out the dangers of heroin overdose, including lapsing into coma or even death. Effects of LSD are just as bad or even worse, he said. “They include dilated pupils, increased heart rate and blood pressure, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors. Some LSD users experience severe terrifying thoughts and feelings, as fear of losing control, fear of insanity, death and despair,” he pointed out. He reiterated his warning on the lethal effects of shabu or methamphetamine which, he stressed, is chemical based. He noted that other illegal substances are from extracts of poppy, a plant variety. “You’d notice that heroin, cocaine are extracts of the poppy. Plant eh. It’s a plant. So they’re not very…you know, they are grown organic,” unlike shabu, Duterte said. Duterte also said the United States had long been in denial about its problem on illegal drugs until President Donald Trump declared a national public health emergency. “As what I’ve been saying, you take time. You take time to realize. I saw it a long time ago. I was still a mayor when I saw the devastation,” he said. “One day to your sorrow, now you see, it is a national health problem. It is health really. It is law and order,” Duterte said. Trump has declared a national emergency to address rampant abuse of opioids that kill more than 140 Americans each day. He called opioid addiction in America a “national shame.” “They just declared. I just listened,” he said as he again taunted former president Barack Obama for criticizing his tough approach to fighting the drug menace. “It’s national, it’s because it affects the health. And illegal substance affects the health and affects the peace. Huwag mong kalimutan ‘yan (Don’t forget that),” the President said. Trump’s declaration, he pointed, has exposed the extent of the drug problem the US is facing. “I told you. So what’s happening to America? It is in total disorder,” he said.  ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Government troops have recovered more than 2,000 pieces of unexploded bombs and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Marawi City while working to restore basic services in the war-devastated city. Lt. Col. Emmanuel Garcia, commander of the 4th Civil Relations Group of the Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said the recovered bombs and IEDs were disposed of under military-supervised controlled detonation operations. The main battle area is still off limits to civilians as soldiers have yet to completely clear the area of booby traps left by the Maute group. Garcia said even the technicians dispatched by a telecommunications firm to fix a damaged cell tower in the main battle area were prevented from proceeding to the area. “They were prevented from going inside as ground forces are still clearing the area of IEDs as well as unexploded munitions,” he added. The Maute group linked to the terrorist organization Islamic State attacked and occupied Marawi City last May 23. The Maute group depended on their stockpile of IEDs to forestall the advance of government forces to their occupied positions, forcing the military leadership to attack them from the air. The military said more than half of the 165 soldiers who died in the fighting were killed in IED explosions planted by the Maute group. The Employees’ Compensation Commission (ECC) issued an order for the speedy processing of benefits for the soldiers and policemen who died or were injured in the battle in Marawi. ECC executive director Stella Zipagan-Banawis the government set aside P2.39 million for the solders injured or killed during the five-month fighting in Marawi. Banawis said of the P2.39 million, P1.75 million is for disability benefits while the remaining P640,000 million is for death benefits.  Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito called on government agencies involved in the reconstruction of Marawi City to strive to make the war-torn city a model for the rest of the country to follow. Ejercito, chairman of the Senate committee on urban planning, housing and resettlement, said he intends to visit Marawi with Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council chairman Eduardo del Rosario and some key urban planning experts in order to assess the scope of the reconstruction effort there. He said that the rebuilding of Marawi is probably more challenging than the reconstruction effort for the areas hit by Typhoon Yolanda because this time around, all that is left of the area is rubble. “We want to do it properly this time. We don’t want another Yolanda. Marawi could emerge as a model LGU (local government unit),” Ejercito said. Military leaders yesterday commended and thanked the 225 members of three elite companies of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division that fought militants in Marawi City. Officials of the 6th ID, led by Major Gen. Arnel dela Vega, took turns thanking the personnel of the division’s 61st, 62nd and 63rd Reconnaissance Companies that helped in liberating Marawi City from the Maute group and Abu Sayyaf. The three companies arrived past 10 a.m. at Camp Siongco in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao from Marawi City. Officials of the three companies said it was difficult fighting terrorists in urban settings, but their men zealously persisted in clearing the areas they were tasked to reclaim from enemies against all odds. Dela Vega told The STAR six of the soldiers they dispatched to Marawi City – Sergeants Vergel dela Cruz and Marlon Hechanova, Private 1st Class Jayson Palma and Privates Aljon Jimenez, Ryan Tamonan and Joshua Gerald Cagud – were wounded in encounters with Maute terrorists. “Our men are lucky, none of them perished in their combat engagements there. We are thankful to those who prayed for their safety and welfare,” he added. – With Sheila Crisostomo, John Unson",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The terror threat remains high in the country despite the recent liberation of Marawi City from militants claiming allegiance to the Middle East-based Islamic State (IS), the research arm of the Fitch Group said in a report. In its latest political risk analysis titled “End of Marawi siege but terror threat remains,” BMI Research said it has maintained a short-term political risk score of 63.1 out of 100 for the Philippines as the threat of terrorism remains high. “While the defeat of militants affiliated with the so-called Islamic State in Marawi City is positive for peace and security and marks a setback for terrorism in the region, we are keeping our short-term political risk score for the Philippines at 63.1 out of 100, which sits below the regional average score of 68.9,” it said. BMI Research pointed out there is likelihood that remnants of the defeated militants might launch retaliatory attacks and some may have already started regrouping in areas around the ruined city. “We believe that it would be premature to upgrade the Philippines’ security score as the Mindanao region remains under martial law and the defeat of the rebel force led by Abu Sayyaf and the Maute is likely to inspire retaliatory attacks in the form of bombings and lone wolf attacks in metro areas, as well as more kidnapping incidents,” it added. President Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi City last Oct. 17 with the death of terrorist leaders Omarkhayam Maute and Isnilon Hapilon of the Abu Sayyaf Group. A total of 847 terrorists, 163 government troops and 47 civilians were killed in the siege, which began on May 23, prompting President Duterte to place the entire Mindanao under martial law. More than 500,000 people have been displaced. “The daunting task of rebuilding the city given the widespread poverty and lack of resources could also provide a fertile breeding ground for other extremist groups,” BMI Research said. It warned that remnants of the Maute group, the Abu Sayyaf and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) were still in the thousands and that they could link up with foreign fighters to complicate the government’s task of eliminating jihadist networks. The Marawi siege has been regarded as “the most serious attempt to export violent extremism and radicalism in the Philippines and in the region” by the Philippine government and has stoked broader concerns about the spread of IS and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The battle for Marawi is also considered the largest campaign that IS has supported outside Syria and Iraq. “Despite the end of the insurgency, we highlight that the threat of terrorism is still very much present in the Philippines and around the region,” it said.  ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will implement the dismissal order of the Office of the Ombudsman against Iloilo City Mayor Jed Patrick Mabilog. DILG officer-in-charge Catalino Cuy said he sent a directive to their regional director in Western Visayas to implement the dismissal order against Mabilog. Cuy said the implementation of the order will likely take place next week, the earliest on Monday, as government offices are closed during the weekend. He said Mabilog does not have to be physically present for the dismissal order to take effect. “The order could be served at his office,” Cuy said. Western Visayas police director Chief Supt. Cesar\n\t Hawthorne Binag said they will implement the DILG order against Mabilog. The ombudsman ordered Mabilog’s dismissal after he was found guilty of serious dishonesty for his questionable wealth. The complaint stemmed from Mabilog’s failure to properly account for his sources of wealth in his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth in 2012 and 2013.  Mabilog fled the country on fears that he might end up like slain mayors Rolando Espinosa of Albuera, Leyte and Reynaldo Parojinog of Ozamis City. Like Espinosa and Parojinog, President Duterte has tagged Mabilog as a narco-politician. Duterte slammed the ombudsman for delaying the order for dismissal of Mabilog. “The ombudsman, in a very, very late gesture, to make it appear that they support me, they fired, stripped him (Mabilog) of his mayorship,” Duterte said told a gathering of the Center for Brighter Beginnings in Davao City last Friday. Duterte also talked about Mabilog’s affinity with opposition leader Sen. Franklin Drilon, a known stalwart of the Liberal Party (LP) and a native of Iloilo City. The LP has vehemently denied the insinuations of drug links.  “Mabilog is, I think a cousin of Drilon. That’s it,” Duterte said, telling the crowd that Mabilog has been booted out of his office. Duterte said he does not care who gets hit by the anti-drug campaign as long as he is able to do his mandate to protect the people’s welfare. –Christina Mendez   \n\t ",

            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — President Duterte granted the wish of an 11-year-old Filipino-American boy for a video message greeting him, his teacher and classmates at the Fresno Adventist Academy in Fresno, California. “I know that you are a very busy person because you are a hardworking president. I admire you greatly. But can I ask you a special favor? Can you please send me a short video clip of you saying hello to my teacher, Mrs. Ricciuti (Ri-kyu-ti), my classmates and I?” Andre Gabriel Custodio Esteban wrote on a note pad, which his mother Almyra Grace posted over social media. Almyra requested netizens to help the boy in his report on Philippine “Nationality” which is due on Nov. 15. As the plea circulated over the internet, it eventually reached Christopher “Bong” Go, the President’s special assistant, who, in turn, raised the concern to Duterte. “Good day. I would like to say hello to Mrs. Ricchuti and her students in Fresno Adventist Academy in California, USA, especially to you Andre Esteban,” the President said in a 48-second video message. “Andre, I received your letter request and I am most happy to oblige. I am sure that you are going to do a great report about our beloved country, the Philippines,” Duterte said, as he urged him to “continue to be a good son and to study well.” “May God bless you and your family and all of us in this planet earth,” the President concluded. The 72-year-old President was clad in a dark blue short-sleeved polo and standing in front of a Christmas tree when he taped his message. Go posted Duterte’s response, which has garnered more than 12,000 likes, over 280 comments, at least 8,400 shares and 313,760 views. “Rest assured that PRRD (Duterte) is working hard to rebuild a brighter future for children like you. We also hope to meet you in person here in the Philippines soon. We are confident that you will do great in your report. Hope this helps. God bless you, Andre,” Go wrote in the post. Esteban said he is a proud Filipino and hopes to meet Duterte someday. He ended his letter saying, “Maraming, maraming salamat po! God bless you po!” On Friday evening, Duterte addressed students of Davao City’s Center for Brighter Beginnings, which was celebrating its 25th founding anniversary, and told them that he is working hard to address the drug menace to give them a better future.          ",

            "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The arrest in Quezon City last Friday of a suspected financier of the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorist group is part of the government’s operations against possible terror threats to the forthcoming Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in the country, a senior anti-terror official bared yesterday. The official, who asked not be named because of the nature of his job, said agents of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) based in Metro Manila who spearheaded the arrest of 42-year-old businessman Rasdi Hamid Malawani are still conducting intelligence build-up against other groups and personalities. “Yes, it’s part of our ongoing security preparations for the ASEAN summit next month,” he said when asked if Malawani’s arrest has links to the ongoing security operations against suspected individuals with perceived capabilities in sowing terror activities during the ASEAN summit. World leaders are expected to be in Manila next month for the ASEAN summit to be held at Clark Field in Pampanga as well as in Metro Manila. Malawani, who also goes by the name Rasi Macabangkit, was nabbed during a raid at his residence at Greenfield Subdivision in Barangay Maligaya, Novaliches, Quezon City the other day. NICA agents backed by Quezon City policemen and elements of naval intelligence nabbed Malawani for illegal possesion of firearms and explosives. The anti-terror official said government agents were able to establish that Malawani took over the businesses of the Maute family in Metro Manila, following the arrest in June of the Maute matriarch, Farhana Ramoto Maute, in Lanao del Sur at the height of the fighting in Marawi City. Farhana’s husband Cayamora Maute, who was also arrested while trying to enter Davao City, died while in detention in Bicutan, Taguig City last August. Farhana, through their family-owned businesses in Metro Manila, has been identified as one of the key financiers of the attack and occupation of Marawi City, spearheaded by her now dead sons, Abdullah and Omarkakhayam. Following Farhana’s arrest, Malawani reportedly took over management of the Maute family businesses, proceeds of which he allegedly transmitted to their contacts in Lanao del Sur to support the Islamic State-inspired terrorists fighting government forces in Marawi City. One of his contacts in the Maute group has been identified as his sister-in-law Lily Zea Macabangki-Maute, wife of one of the slain Maute brothers. “Disruption operations, either perceived or real terror threats, are continuing in line with our sustained security preparations for the ASEAN summit,” the anti-terror official said. He also bared that aside from the bazaar owned by the Maute family in Novaliches, they also own other businessess that include hardware stores in Metro Manila. The anti-terror official assured legitimate Muslim traders in Metro Manila they need not worry as the ongoing security operations are all intelligence-driven, being a product of target hardening done by various law enforcement agencies.  Aside from suspected Maute supporters, the source said that parallel intelligence monitoring is also being done to determine plans and movements of the communst insurgents, in relation to the upcoming ASEAN summit. The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) yesterday assured the public that there is no immediate threat from terrorist groups in Metro Manila despite the recent arrest of a suspected financier of the Maute group. “We have not received any information although we have been saying we always assume a high threat level in Metro Manila,” NCRPO Director Oscar Albayalde told radio station dzBB. Chief Supt. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar, Quezon City Police District director, said charges of illegal possession of firearms and explosives were filed against Malawani before the Quezon City prosecutor’s office last Thursday. Albayalde urged the public to report suspicious looking persons who might sow terror in the metropolis. “We must remain alert and vigilant. Let’s immediately report anything out of the ordinary,” said Albayalde. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) will strictly implement a “no-fly zone” for drones in the areas where the events of the 31st ASEAN Summit will be held from Nov. 9 to 17 in Manila and Clark in Pampanga. CAAP Director General Capt. Jim Sydiongco warned all drones or unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV) owners, operators and hobbyists to refrain from using them in the said dates and areas or face stiff penalties and possible confiscation. The agency issued notice to airmen (NOTAM B4588/17) of no drone operations from Nov. 9 to 17, 40 nautical miles radius centered on Luneta Park and NOTAM B4593/17, 40 nautical miles radius centered on Clark in Pampanga. CAAP said that Memorandum Circular No. 21 series of 2014 and its amendments in Memorandum Circular No. 35 prohibit the flying of drones or UAVs over populated areas, restricted areas such as airports and no-fly zones such as military training camps and Malacañang. The memorandum states that no person may operate a UAV for hire or reward unless in possession of a UAV Certificate of Authorization from CAAP that authorizes the person to operate the UAV. Owners or operators are required to register their equipment with the CAAP and secure a certification to operate from the agency. Under the provisions of the Philippine Civil Aviation Regulations (PCAR), any operator found violating rules of the memorandum will pay fines ranging from P300,000 to P500,000 depending on the gravity of the violation and confiscation of the UAV. Meanwhile, a security guard who acted as a terrorist during a simulation exercise was injured after a member of the police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) accidentally shot him using a loaded firearm in Malay, Aklan on Friday. Supt. Gilbert Gorero, spokesman of the Western Visayas police, said the incident happened at around 8 p.m. at the Caticlan Airport police station in Barangay Caticlan. Members of the Avsegroup were conducting a drill where the scenario is a suspected terrorist having slipped into the airport. The person who acted as the terrorist is Nhick Tanan, 29, a security guard at the airport. Malay police commander Chief Insp. Mark Evan Salvo said one of the policemen, Police Officer 2 Benedicto Etrata, 27, shot Tanan, unaware that his .9mm pistol was loaded with a live bullet. “He told us he put back the firearm’s magazine while inside the comfort room,” Salvo said in a phone interview. Tanan suffered a gunshot wound in the right chest. He is currently confined at a local hospital. Etrata, who immediately surrendered after the incident, was placed on restrictive custody pending investigation. With Rudy Santos, Emmanuel Tupas  ",

            "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte has appointed Harry Roque as presidential spokesman and the President’s first order to Roque is not to change his message. Duterte confirmed Roque’s appointment during the dinner he tendered for Roque’s birthday on Friday night in Davao City. Roque, who served as representative of Kabayan party-list, will be given a rank of secretary. The President said Roque should be able to tell the Filipino people exactly what he wants to tell them. “To get the message clear, I said, Harry will fit the – kasi medyo malikot ang bunganga namin (because our language is colorful),” Duterte said during the birthday dinner for Roque at the Marina Tuna Seafood Restaurant in Davao City. “He is no longer a congressman. He is now a secretary. To make his entrance dramatic, he will be attending the first Cabinet meeting on Monday (Nov. 6),” he added. Roque will be replacing Ernesto Abella, who always clarified the President’s controversial statements. Abella was reportedly offered a position in another government agency.  Abella has not yet issued a statement about Roque replacing him as presidential spokesman. Roque, a human rights lawyer, has been supporting Duterte since the campaign for the 2016 presidential elections.  Roque told The STAR he is joining the President on a working visit today until Tuesday.  “I am ready for whatever I am tasked to do,” he added. While the President said he wants Roque to tell the people exactly what he wants to say, Roque indicated yesterday that he hoped to convince the President to tweak his bloody anti-drug war and change his views on human rights. Roque explained he accepted Duterte’s offer “with the specific purpose of getting an audience with the President to address key human rights issues in the Philippines.”  “As a member of Congress, my voice is limited. Politicians who relentlessly criticize the administration are simply ignored and labeled as ‘destabilizers.’ By taking this position, I hope to be able to advise the President directly regarding the manner and methods he has used to tackle the problem of drugs. I have already expressed my willingness to serve as an adviser on the matter,” he said. He said he remains an advocate of human rights and Duterte’s statements on human rights issues “are precisely what drew me towards the position of spokesperson.”  “Over the past two years, the administration has repeatedly clarified and reinterpreted the remarks of the President. More often than not, the media and the Filipino people have looked to the spokesperson to determine the true intention behind the President’s statements. Thus, the spokesperson plays a pivotal role in confirming the policy of the state,” he said.  “By taking up this position, I intend to refocus the attention of the people more towards the fundamental position of the state, and less towards the manner by which such has been declared. Similarly, I am committing to reduce, if not totally eradicate, the impact of statements which appear to support genocide or violations of fundamental human rights,” he added. The former human rights lawyer pointed out that by agreeing to be the President’s spokesman, “I am not condoning the violence surrounding the government’s anti-drug campaign, nor do I intend to further the same.” “Regardless of whether I am a member of Congress or of the President’s Cabinet, I continue to value the right to life and dignity of every person and do not support the arbitrary killing of any person by the state,” he added. Opposition congressmen and even Roque’s own party-list group Kabayan yesterday welcomed his departure from the House of Representatives, saying Roque is finally released from “masquerading” as a human rights defender. “We wish Roque well in his job of justifying the unjustifiable and defending the indefensible pronouncements and policies of the President,” Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said. “To be the communications czar of Duterte, one has to be an expert mortician undertaking the post-mortem embellishment of the President’s crude and unfounded pronouncements and policies, and must be able to subdue one’s conscience in order to emote platitudes,” he added. He said Roque’s acceptance of Duterte’s offer “confirms his dubious role in defending the President’s wayward policies even as he is nominally a deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives.” “Roque has minimized the grave import of the unabated extrajudicial killings related to the President’s deadly campaign against the drug menace; he voted for the confirmation of the declaration of marital law and its extension; and he did not vote against the reduction of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) budget to P1,000 and even called for a zero budget for the CHR,” Lagman bared. Roque also “failed to criticize Duterte’s predisposition to authoritarian rule and intention to declare a revolutionary government and he advocated for the creation of a panel to investigate the ombudsman and recommend her impeachment for unwarranted and politically motivated reasons. “The charade is now over as Roque is liberated and obligated to be the President’s official apologist,” he added. Ifugao Rep. Teodoro Baguilat Jr. congratulated his colleagues on his new job. “As a self-proclaimed human rights advocate, I wish him luck in defending the horrendous human rights record of this administration. The appointment also releases him from the challenge of masquerading as a minority leader,” he said. Another opposition congressman, Tom Villarin of Akbayan, said Duterte and Roque “deserve each other – a principal who advocates mass murder and a lawyer who masquerades as a human rights defender.”  “It’s politically opportunistic for both as one faces imminent trial in the International Criminal Court and a UP law professor well-versed in international law that could defend him,” he said. “On the flipside, an ambitious neophyte congressman eyeing a senatorial seat thus will be riding on the popularity of someone he will always be speaking about. Kudos to both!” he added. Roque belongs to the group of Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez, a staunch ally of former president and Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Suarez fought with the Lagman-Baguilat group for the minority leadership, with the Quezon lawmaker winning the fight. – With Jess Diaz      ",

            "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Not discounting the possibility that terrorists would take advantage of the influx of passengers during the upcoming holdays, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente instructed Bureau of Immigration (BI) personnel to beef up security at the country’s airports and seaports. During the observance of All Saints’ Day on Nov. 1 and All Souls’ Day on Nov. 2, terrorists might try to use the high volume of inbound and outbound travelers and the confusion that comes with a large crowd to slip into the country and disrupt activities in the upcoming 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and Related Meetings set on Nov. 13-15. BI acting spokesman Grifton Medina said immigration officers in all international airports and seaports nationwide have been instructed to be doubly strict and vigilant in screening travelers.  “Our officers were told to refer for secondary inspection foreigners who have doubtful purposes in entering the country and those who have questionable travel documents,” Medina said.  Departing Filipinos would also be thoroughly screened to ensure that they are not victims of human trafficking and illegal recruitment, he added. Morente cancelled the leaves of BI employees assigned at the ports starting Oct. 29 unless they are able to present valid reasons for being absent from work. “Commissioner Morente has also alerted our personnel assigned to border crossing stations in Mindanao and Palawan to coordinate and team up with other agencies such as the Navy and Coast Guard in policing our backdoors in the South,” Medina said.  Meanwhile, Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) spokesman Captain Armand Balilo said they are expecting the volume of sea travelers to peak starting today until Oct. 31. Since they officially implemented Oplan Biyaheng Ayos last Oct. 26, they have observed that the volume of passengers in several ports were still manageable. Balilo said passengers bound to and from Manila and going to the Visayas and Mindanao might build up on Oct. 29 and 30, while many of those traveling only short routes such as Batangas to Mindoro might start their trips on Oct. 30 and 31. Oct. 31 has been declared a special non-working day, while Nov. 1 is a regular holiday. He also appealed to passengers to travel early to decongest the number of people at the ports. They should also be at the seaport at least three hours before departure time. He added that they have already increased their visibility and security at the various seaports nationwide to assist the passengers. “The bottom line here is security and safety. All our operating units have been placed on heightened alert. Coast Guard officer-in-charge Commodore Joel Garcia has also given instructions that if our personnel in Bicol and Batangas would need additional Coast Guard personnel, our headquarters would be sending them augmentation teams,” Balilo added. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and the Manila International Airport (MIAA) started implementing Oplan Undas 2017 last Friday in  anticipation of the heavy volume of passengers going to different provinces to commemorate All Saints Day and All Soul’s Day. Under the said operation plan, CAAP added security measures that will be in place to ensure safe, reliable and convenient operations at all 39 commercial airports in the country in the next two weeks. MIAA and CAAP have coordinated with domestic airlines regarding the efficient processing of passengers, especially at check-in counters and additional airline personnel will be deployed as needed to accommodate travelers. MIAA general manager Ed Monreal said that his office provided medical tents with sufficient doctors and nurses, help desks for passengers inquiries and more security personnel including bomb sniffing dogs to patrol the four terminals so that passengers will feel secure while at the airport. Domestic check-in counters will be open two hours before scheduled departure, while passengers on international flights counters may check in three hours before departure. Counters will be closed 45 minutes before actual departure time. Ninoy Aquino Internationa Airport (NAIA) terminal managers and personnel from the Public Affairs Office will be visible to entertain passengers inquiries or complaints, if any. Monreal is scheduled to inspect NAIA terminals on Monday morning to ensure that all facilities and services are ready and properly manned.  Travelers are reminded not to bring prohibited items to the airport and to stow all belongings in one’s carry-on baggage for faster processing at the screening checkpoints. A road safety advocacy group yesterday appealed to motorists traveling this All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day to drive safely, especially when they have children traveling with them. According to Einstein Rojas, a member of the New Vois Association of the Philippines, “it is imperative that motorists observe all the necessary safety precautions when driving home to their respective provinces or even just staying in the metropolis for the holidays.” “ It is important for us to stay safe when on the road as untoward incidents are easily avoidable if proper safety measures are observed,” he said. Roas noted that motorists should observe simple road safety tips such as “not calling or texting while driving, not drinking alcoholic beverages if you will drive and not driving if you are sleepy.” He underscored the importance of always wearing seatbelt and always following traffic rules, especially speed limits.  For those riding motorcycles or bicycles, Rojas said they should always wear helmets. Rojas also urged motorists to install child safety car seats in their vehicles to protect children in case of accident. With Rudy Santos, Sheila Crisostomo   ",

            "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — For the fourth time, the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has denied the petition of former Commission on Elections (Comelec) chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. to dismiss th graft case filed against him in connection with the alleged anomalous purchase of P1.7 million worth of service vehicles in 2003. In a five-page resolution dated Oct. 25, the court’s Sixth Division denied Abalos’ motion to dismiss his graft case filed early this month. The denial of Abalos’ motion came with a stern warning to his legal counsel “that continued misuse of judicial processes shall be dealt with more severely.” The Sixth Division made the warning as Abalos’ camp still filed a motion to dismiss despite the court’s earlier denial of his motion to quash the case as well as his two motions for reconsideration on the motion to quash. The anti-graft court further noted that Abalos also filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court assailing the Sixth Division’s denial of his first motion for reconsideration. The Sixth Division noted that while Abalos withdrew his petition before the SC on Sept. 4, he subsequently filed a motion to dismiss before the anti-graft court. The Sixth Division agreed with the prosecution’s argument that Abalos’ acts can be considered as forum-shopping and is a mere dilatory tactic. The court said the argument raised by Abalos in his motion to dismiss was a mere rehash of the very same argument he raised in his motion to quash and his two motions for reconsideration. “The filing by counsel for the accused of the motion under consideration – a rehash of the accused’s motion to quash which, along with his two motions for reconsideration, had all been denied – appears to be nothing but a dilatory tactic or a misuse of court processes, in contravention of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and which runs counter to the objective of the rules of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding,” the court’s ruling read. The resolution was penned by division chairman Associate Justice Sarah Jane Fernandez with the concurrence of Associate Justices Karl Miranda and Bernelito Fernandez. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman on Oct. 7, 2016, the graft case against Abalos stemmed from his alleged anomalous purchase of two units of Toyota Revo VX 200 totaling P1.7 million in 2003 during his term as Comelec chairman. The ombudsman said the purchase was done without public bidding but rather through unauthorized small-value procurement also referred to as “shopping.” Abalos, both in his motion to quash and motion to dismiss, said the case must be dismissed on the ground of the supposed “inordinate delay” of the ombudsman in investigating the complaint against him before filing the case in court. Abalos said the period of eight years (2008 to 2016) it took the ombudsman to finish its probe was unjustifiable, “capricious and vexatious” and is tantamount to violation of his Constitutional right to speedy disposition of his case. The Sixth Division, however, had repeatedly maintained that there was no inordinate delay in the ombudsman’s investigation of the complaint against the former Comelec chief. The Sixth Division maintained that the ombudsman investigation only began on Aug. 23, 2013 and not in October 2008 as earlier claimed by Abalos. The court also said that since the start of the investigation in 2013, the ombudsman has been exerting efforts to get Abalos’ side and to resolve the complaint.  ",

            "timestamp": "October 29, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The government has allocated P843 million for next year to jumpstart the nationwide implementation of the public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program, Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel said yesterday. He said the amount has been included in the 2018 budget of the Department of Transportation (DOTr). “It is a highly constructive program overall. The government is basically stepping in to assure the public a better way to commute in the years ahead, while giving PUV operators and drivers the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles,” he said. Pimentel added the operation of PUVs on public roads is a privilege granted by the government.  “This is why we have a franchising system. Those who are in the business of running PUVs have to live up to higher operating standards to ensure that commuters are safely, efficiently and conveniently transferred,” Pimentel stressed. He pointed out the modernization program is also expected to create jobs in the automotive industry, a key sector of the economy, and curb pollution. “There’s no question the shift to low-emission vehicles will help reduce pollutants and improve air quality in a big way,” he said. Under the program, all PUVs that are more than 15 years old will be phased out and replaced with new models equipped with automated fare collection systems, digital security and dashboard cameras, WiFi internet connectivity, global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices and speed limiters. A combined P2.5-billion special financing plan from two state-run banks will extend low-cost loans to enable PUV operators and drivers to acquire the newly designed passenger buses, vans and jeepneys, Pimentel said. He said the new PUVs would run either on Euro 4 compliant diesel engines that discharge 68 percent less particulate matter, 57 percent less nitrogen oxides and 50 percent less carbon monoxide, or on electric batteries that have zero exhaust gas emissions. The modernization program also reforms the franchising system to strengthen control over and regulation of PUVs, he said.  He added that fewer new franchises would be issued to PUV operators and drivers who would be compelled to organize themselves into cooperatives or firms to build up accountability, enforcement and compliance. Pimentel explained that in the case of jeepneys, each operator must have a minimum of 10 units to obtain a single franchise.  Thus, drivers running their own units would have to consolidate themselves into groups of at least 10 members to get a franchise, he said. He said the DOTr is expected to draw up new PUV routes in consultation with local government units. The modernization program has become controversial owing to the strong opposition of militant jeepney operators and drivers grouped under the Pinagkaisang Samahan ng Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (Piston), which has vowed to stage monthly transport strikes unless President Duterte talks to them. In response, the President has warned that PUVs of defiant operators and drivers would be towed away and impounded.",

            "content": "CAMP VICENTE LIM, Laguna , Philippines — What should have been a birthday celebration ended in tragedy after eight persons drowned when their boat capsized in Laguna de Bay off Binangonan, Rizal on Sunday. Neymariet Mendoza; Malou Gimena, 39; Marilou Papa, 44; Frederick Orteza, 43; Weldy Pareño, Rolino Pareño Jr., Sean Wilfred Orteza, 6, and Jianna Jensen Pareño, 2, were declared dead on arrival at the Margarito Duavit Rizal Provincial Hospital. The boat operator, Gerson Decrito, who was among those who survived the accident, saved three other passengers. Another passenger managed to swim to the shore. They were taken to the same hospital for treatment. The victims were on their way to a fishpond to attend the birthday of Decrito’s wife when the accident occurred at around 2 p.m. Initial investigation showed the boat, which has only one outrigger, tilted and capsized when the passengers took selfies about 50 meters away from their destination in Sitio Wawa, Barangay Libis. Probers said some of the fatalities were trapped under the capsized boat, which is made of fiberglass. Personnel of the Philippine Coast Guard and Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council helped in the search and rescue operations. Chief Inspector Dwight Forte, Binangonan police chief, ordered an investigation to determine whether there was negligence on the part of the boat operator. While there were life vests on the boat, none of the victims wore them. Meanwhile, in Pangasinan, a security guard drowned when he tried to save his relative while swimming on a beach in Barangay Nibaliw Narvarte, San Fabian also on Sunday. Renante Eisma, 36, a resident of Barangay Crystal Cave, Baguio City, was pronounced dead on arrival at Region 1 Medical Center. Jericho Colting, 13, is now in stable condition at the Medical Centrum. – With Cecille Suerte Felipe, Cesar Ramirez, Eva Visperas",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Makati City regional trial court (RTC) has ordered Sunvar Realty Development Corp. to pay the government P478.2 million in back rent for illegally occupying the Mile Long property since 2003. In a 22-page decision dated Oct. 11, Judge Maryann Corpus-Mañalac of RTC Branch 141 also told Sunvar to pay the National Power Corp. (NPC), which owns the property, a monthly rental of P3.2 million from June 2015 until it vacates the property.  Mañalac considered Sunvar’s payment to the NPC “as reasonable compensation for the use and occupancy of the premises.” She is referring to the several instances where the Office of the Solicitor General, the NPC’s counsel, has sent Sunvar notices to vacate Mile Long in February 2008 and January 2009. The NPC then filed an unlawful detainer complaint on July 23, 2009 against Sunvar. It was only in August this year that Sunvar vacated the Mile Long property and turned it over to the NPC following a resolution from the Court of Appeals. Aside from the order to pay the government, Mañalac also dismissed Sunvar’s claim for damages and for reimbursement for the improvement done on the disputed property.  The NPC and the government are the registered owners of the land between Pasong Tamo Extension and Vito Cruz Extension with a total of 125,607 square meters where the disputed Mile Long property is located. Sunvar, owned by the Prieto family, has improved the subleased property consisting of Premier Cinema, Mile Long Arcade, Makati Creekside, The Gallery and Sunvar Plaza, while other parts were used as parking areas.",

In a resolution released to the media yesterday, the PET dismissed the motion of the poll body, saying the Comelec should cover the accumulated costs after its failure to bring the election materials back to its office in Manila. It rejected the poll body’s argument that the ballot boxes were returned to Manila due to the Precautionary Protective Order (PPO) issued by the tribunal in Marcos’ election protest against Vice President Leni Robredo. “There is nothing in the PPO that prohibited the physical transfer of the election materials and paraphernalia; the Comelec was merely required to preserve and safeguard their integrity. Thus, the Comelec’s proffered reason that its faithful compliance to the PPO has no basis,” the PET stressed. The Comelec said it accepts the PET’s decision while Marcos’ camp welcomed the development.",

Based on the complaint released yesterday, Corvera failed to return a total of P685,477.65 from 1999 to 2007 “without justifiable cause” and despite repeated demands by the municipal government. Graft probers said Tordesillas conspired with Corvera in preparing disbursement vouchers and certifying the completeness of supporting documents to make it appear that liquidations have been made. The ombudsman said  failure to return the  cash advances is tantamount to misappropriation of public funds for personal use and benefit of the respondents. Bail was recommended at P70,000 each.",

In a seven-page resolution promulgated on Oct. 25, the court’s Second Division reversed its April 28, 2016 ruling granting the Coronas’ motion to recall the subpoena earlier issued concerning the couple’s bank accounts. The resolution was penned by division chairman Associate Justice Oscar Herrera Jr. with the concurrence of Associate Justices Michael Frederick Musngi and Lorifel Pahimna. The court gave weight to the prosecution’s argument that the presentation of the Corona couple’s bank records would not violate Republic Act 1405 or the Bank Secrecy Law. Bank records are exempted from the confidentiality rule if there is an order from a competent court for their presentation in connection with “cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials or in cases where money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation,” the court said. In a subpoena issued on Jan. 18, 2016, the Second Division ordered the production of bank transaction records of the Corona couple, including those pertaining to an account under the name of the late chief justice. Representatives from several banks were also summoned to testify on the subpoenaed bank documents in connection with the P130.59-million civil forfeiture case filed against the Coronas in March 2014. The forfeiture case is an offshoot of Corona’s impeachment trial for failing to declare several assets from 2001 to 2011. The Second Division directed its sheriff’s office to freeze the couple’s assets but sheriff Alexander Valencia said in a March 18, 2016 report that only P15,000 of the Coronas’ money has been frozen. The sheriff’s office also garnished several condominium units and a parcel of land owned the couple.",

Newly installed chief of staff Lt. Gen Rey Leonardo Guerrero said there will be changes to the operational guidelines of the armed forces, especially for ground forces involved in counter-terrorism operations on elevated terrain. \"There will be changes (to the doctrine). In fact we have already initiated steps to revisit our war fighting doctrines and the lessons learned as a result of the Marawi incident,\" Guerrero said in his first visit to the Western Mindanao Command based here. Military doctrine is considered the theoretical foundation by which forces guide their actions to achieve certain objectives. It is not considered a set of rules, but a body of principles flexible enough to be applied to different circumstances. Over the past six months, soldiers were engaged in urban warfare with Islamist radicals inspired by the global terrorist organization Islamic State. The militants positioned themselves in buildings and other structures for defense. A Scout Ranger, who was among the soldiers given a heroes welcome on Monday, said enemies were well trained and had good snipers among them. \"Just imagine, my buddy just accidentally exposed his arm for few seconds was already hit by sniper out of nowhere. The fight in urban was totally different compared to the jungle,” a member of the 5th Scout Ranger Battalion said.

Gerardo Amolato Maquidato Jr. “was killed by still unidentified suspects, who booked and rode as regular passengers before shooting him and fleeing in his vehicle,” Grab said in a statement yesterday. Grab said Maquidato was killed at around 7:50 p.m. on Thursday while driving a silver Toyota Innova with plate number YV 7109. A witness said Maquidato was shoved out of the car along Bonanza street in Pasay. Grab refused to name Maquidato’s last passenger so as not to jeopardize an ongoing police investigation. Grab has reported six confirmed cases of carnapping incidents involving vehicles under their platforms. “These incidents were perpetrated by criminals pretending to be legitimate passengers,” it said. Maquidato earned praise from netizens when he did not accept payment from a sick passenger in October last year. A relative of the passenger narrated the incident in a Facebook post. Grab said it is working on a tech solution “that would decrease, if not completely hamper” the carjackings. “We encourage our driver-partners to be vigilant, and to use 911 hotline for emergency cases,” it added.",

Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay and Isabela City in Basilan comprise the Zamboanga peninsula. President Duterte declared Marawi liberated from terrorists on Oct. 17 while military officials said fighting with Maute militants, which started on May 23, ended last Monday.  However, the President said martial law would stay “until the last terrorist is taken out.” Salazar said Muslims, Christians and lumads in the region have been cooperating in the implementation of security measures including the no ID, no entry policy since martial law was declared in Mindanao on May 24. In a resolution approved last June, the RPOC backed the declaration of martial law and the proposal for a national identification system, saying it would address security concerns in Min-danao. Salazar said the RPOC would take the cue from the President on the implementation of martial law. “We will await the order of the President,” she said.  Meanwhile, the city government said it would honor soldiers who fought in Marawi upon their return to their respective units.       ",

Archie Angob, Vicente Baltazar and Ramil Layan were brought to the Navotas police station after they were arrested at a bingo outlet in Harrison Plaza in Manila. Taxi driver Norberto Pagnanawon, 60, said he was held up along C-4 Road in Navotas City by the three men at around 1:30 a.m. yesterday. Pagnanawon said Baltazar pointed an ice pick at him, threatened to kill him and pushed him out of his vehicle. Pagnanawon’s son, Merbert, said his father, following the location indicated by the taxi’s GPS tracker device, went to the bingo outlet at Harrison Plaza and found the vehicle. The driver then asked police officers at the Malate police station for help. He later learned from the police that the suspects were arrested while they were playing bingo. When the suspects faced the Navotas police, Baltazar said he just needed money for drinks and bingo that night. “Please forgive us, sir, even though we will have a case,” Baltazar told the driver in Filipino. They are set to face robbery-holdup and carnapping charges. Carnapping is a nonbailable offense. The other two suspects denied conspiring with Baltazar to rob Pagnanawon, saying Baltazar only invited them to hang out. The suspects said they did not know there was a police station near the bingo outlet. Asked by police what he could say to the suspects, Pagnanawon said he was willing to give them money had they not held him up. “I’m a generous man,” Pagnanawon told the suspects. The suspects said they did not win back the P3,500 they bet in bingo games after stealing the money from Pagnanawon.",

Laguerta said Phivolcs is monitoring other critical indicators such as sulfur gas output. He said the volcano have emitted an average of 441 tons of sulfur dioxide since Oct. 17.  Leveling data obtained from Sept. 16 to 21 also indicated slight inflation of the volcano’s edifice.  Cedric Daep, Albay Provincial Security and Emergency Management Office head, warned the public against going up to the crater, saying it is “very risky.”  Daep said it is difficult to determine when the volcano would spew ash despite round-the-clock detailed monitoring.   He said the provincial government spent a lot of money to retrieve the bodies of four German tourists and their local guide who were trapped during a sudden ash explosion on May 7, 2013.  “Those caught by ash explosion at the southeast quadrant are difficult to evacuate because... it is not readily accessible,” Daep said.  ",

Ampatuan’s camp claimed that the judge erred when she denied his bail plea as she merely relied on testimonial evidence without any corroboration. The defense likewise noted that the prosecution failed to provide physical evidence that would prove the suspect’s guilt, such as a ballistics reports or analysis of fingerprints and DNA. But in her ruling, Solis-Reyes noted that bail proceedings are preliminary in nature and that the court does not expect the prosecution to present all of its evidence. The judge stressed that the court is not making any judgment on the guilt or innocence of Ampatuan, but merely on the issue of whether or not the evidence is strong. Last May, Solis-Reyes denied the bail plea of Ampatuan after finding strong evidence that he participated in the massacre that claimed the lives of 58 people, including 32 media practitioners. Ampatuan and members of the once-powerful political clan were among the 197 suspects initially charged in relation with the massacre, dubbed as the single worst incident for journalists in history. More than 100 suspects have already been arrested and are currently undergoing different stages in trial. Some of them have already died in prison. The Ampatuans denied involvement in the massacre.        ",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is to blame for the Batasan truck accident that claimed the lives of five persons on Thursday, Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo said yesterday. “The LTO appears to be a completely useless agency of the government. It might as well be abolished,” he said.  He said the LTO is empowered by law to check on the roadworthiness of motor vehicles before it registers them. That is why the agency has its so-called motor vehicle inspection system (MVIS), he said. “What is the use of the MVIS if it cannot detect defects in vehicles – especially trucks and buses – before they are registered?” Castelo asked.  He lamented that MVIS personnel merely conduct “token” inspections of vehicles and do not really care about their roadworthiness.  “LTO has not made any effort to acquire instruments and technology or hire competent people to conduct proper vehicle inspection. ,” he said. Castelo has filed a resolution seeking an inquiry into the series of road accidents involving trucks and other heavy vehicles so that Congress could craft appropriate laws on road safety and accident prevention.  He noted that in 2015 alone, 129 out of 779 fatal accidents in Metro Manila involved trucks, accounting for almost 20 percent of road crashes that resulted in deaths. Trucks are the second leading cause of fatal accidents in the metropolis, next to motorcycles, he said. He said in many cases, the drivers of trucks involved in these accidents were found lacking in proper training and did not qualify to drive heavy vehicles, yet they were given a professional driver’s license by LTO.  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board has cancelled the franchise of the company that owns the truck involved in the Batasan accident. The board said it could not check on the truck’s roadworthiness, since that is within the jurisdiction of LTO. The truck driver said he lost control of the vehicle after its brakes failed.",

The three companies, trained in quick emergency reaction and in commando-style assaults, arrived past 10 a.m. Saturday at Camp Siongco in Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao from Marawi City. “They left Marawi City before dawn (Saturday) and their travel from there to Camp Siongco lasted for about five hours,” Dela Vega said. Dela Vega said six of the soldiers they dispatched to Marawi City — Sergeants Vergel Dela Cruz and Marlon Hechanova, Private 1st Class Jayson Palma, and Privates Aljon Jimenez, Ryan Tamonan and Joshua Gerald Cagud — were wounded in encounters with Maute terrorists. “Our men are lucky none of them perished in their combat engagements there. We are thankful to those who prayed for their safety and welfare,” Dela Vega said. Officials of the three companies said it was difficult fighting terrorists in urban settings but their men zealously persisted in clearing the areas they were tasked to reclaim from enemies.",

They were arrested at Barangay Datu Balabaran, Cotabato City by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The PDEA-ARMM, in a statement emailed Saturday, said the four men were nabbed in the act of selling shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to an agent disguised as drug dependent. One of their companions, Salindatu Sabdullah, a resident of Barangay Kakar in nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao, managed to escape when he saw PDEA-ARMM personnel frisked and cuffed his four accomplices. The arrested suspects, all tagged as large-scale dealers of shabu in Barangay Balabaran, are now in the custody of PDEA-ARMM. The PDEA-ARMM said they shall be prosecuted based on the P300,000 worth of shabu recovered from them. Agents also impounded the two motorcycles they use in distributing their illegal merchandise to contacts in remote villages in Cotabato City. PDEA agents in Region 12 also arrested Jerson Pacardo Rendon in Barangay San Vicente in Banga, South Cotabato a day before the agency's operation in Cotabato City that resulted in the arrest of four local shabu dealers. Rendon, who is in PDEA-12's list of \"high value targets, is a distributor of dried marijuana and has conduits in different barangays in Banga and in nearby Surallah and Noralla towns in South Cotabato.

            "content": "LANAO DEL SUR — Authorities are now guarding high-ticket infrastructure projects vulnerable to sabotage by militants after suffering from a severe defeat in Marawi City this month. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr. of the Western Mindanao Command said on Saturday that it is part of an effort to help ensure the completion of on-going projects in remote areas in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao by its regional government. \"These projects will improve the lives of people, generate livelihood for them, give children easy access to schools and make convenient the delivery of health, education, social welfare and other basic services to them. That is what militants do not want to happen,\" Galvez said. The Maute group and its allies, the Abu Sayyaf and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, are rabidly opposed to infrastructure projects that could weaken their influence on peasant communities from where they forcibly collect money for food and other needs. The three militant groups are using the flag of global terror group Islamic State as their revolutionary banners. Police Chief Superintendet Graciano Mijares, director of the Police Regional Office-ARMM, said on Saturday that law enforcement activities in many far-flung areas are a lot easier with new roads and bridges built in the past four years. \"Securing on-going infrastructure projects of the ARMM government is one serious concern for us,\" Mijares said. Drone recordings and a matrix obtained from the Department of Public Works and Highways-ARMM indicated that in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur alone, the agency constructed 24 bridges in the two provinces from 2014 to late 2016. The 24 bridges, costing P686.1 million, now connects once isolated farming enclaves to town centers where farmers sell their farm products that in the past rotted in their barns during rainy days. The products could not be transported to markets due to the absence of all-weather overland arterial networks. The bridges were built by the office of ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman and the regional public works department, through the district engineering offices in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur, using allocations from the region's yearly infrastructure budget from the national coffer. Records from state auditors indicated that the Hataman administration spent P211.5 million for the 16 bridges built in Lanao del Sur in the past three years. Eight larger bridges costing P474.5 million were also built in Maguindanao during the period. Galvez said officials of component-units of WestMinCom based in Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur where the 24 bridges were constructed have noticed dramatic improvements in the lives of local residents. \"That is something violent religious extremists are trying to prevent from happening,\" Galvez said. Galvez and Mijares, who assumed as ARMM police director only last October 20, separately told The STAR they will cooperate in securing on-going infrastructure projects in the autonomous region from militant groups using poverty, neglect and underdevelopment as talking points in recruiting potential members. Units of WestMinCom and the ARMM police tightened security last week in areas where workers are constructing strategic stretches of the P1 billion worth \"transcentral road\" in Basilan due to threats of attacks by the Abu Sayyaf. The more than 60-kilometer thoroughfare will traverse the remaining enclaves in Basilan's Sampinit and Punoh Mahadje areas of remnants of the Abu Sayyaf. ARMM police officials said more than a hundred suspects in heinous crimes were arrested from between 2015 to October 2017 in remote areas in towns that were made accessible to patrol cars and military armored vehicles by roads and bridges constructed by the regional government in recent years.  ",

The alleged leader of the kidnapping syndicate, Police Officer 3 Rodel Estonactoc, 41, of the Quezon City police; dismissed Rizal police officer Ramil Espejo, 38; former police Special Action Force commando Rolando Albios and Erwin Escobido, 32, were in a silver Mitsubishi Adventure (ABQ-6451) when they reportedly pulled out their guns and fired at anti-kidnapping operatives who spotted them along San Lazaro Road in Barangay Mabuhay at around 4:10 a.m.  They died at the scene. Police said a caliber .45 and three 9mm pistols were recovered from the fatalities. Senior Superintendent Glenn Dumlao, Philippine National Police-Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) director, said the encounter followed two days of intelligence operations. Dumlao said the suspects kidnapped Chinese businessman Carlos Tan and his driver along the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Expressway in Parañaque on Saturday last week. Dumlao said Tan’s family sought their assistance after the kidnappers demanded P50 million. He said the AKG monitored the negotiations between the families of the victims. ‘We negotiated for P5 million, but the kidnappers insisted on P10 million,” Dumlao said in an interview over dzBB. Shortly after they lost communication with the kidnappers, Dumlao said Tan’s driver sought police assistance following his release in Tagaytay. The driver said Tan could have been killed by his captors, noting that he heard two gunshots before he was released. On Sunday, police found Tan’s body being eaten by a monitor lizard in a ravine in Tagaytay. At noon yesterday, another police officer implicated in Tan’s kidnap-slay, SPO1 Benjamin Pagarigan of the Quezon City police, surrendered in Moncada, Tarlac. Dumlao said the driver positively identified Pagarigan and the slain suspects. A manhunt for two other suspects, including another police officer, is underway. Dumlao said the other suspect is a gambler at Resorts World Manila, who provided Tan’s profile to the kidnappers. Meanwhile, in Pangasinan, four suspected members of a robbery gang who have yet to be identified allegedly shot it out with police at a hotel in Poblacion District 11 in Pozorrubio. Chief Inspector Melicio Medina, town police chief, said the suspects opened fire at personnel of the Ilocos region police and Criminal Investigation and Detection Group who responded to reports on the presence of armed men who checked into the hotel. No one was reported hurt among the law enforcers. Medina said assorted firearms and a black Toyota Fortuner with no license plates were recovered from the fatalities. – With Eva Visperas",

Unson said the gesture was his expression of his love for the country and citizens and of his sympathy to the fallen soldiers and police officers of the Marawi conflict. “Most importantly, [this gesture is] to suit my desire to help protect the country’s tri-people and visiting foreigners and immigrants from harm that violent religious extremists can do using improvised explosive devices,” he said in his deed of donation.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III yesterday said he implemented the dismissal order recently issued by the Office of the Ombudsman against Ma. Asuncion Isabel Gargalicano of Guimbal town after she was found guilty of grave misconduct. The ombudsman also ordered Gargalicano’s perpetual disqualification from holding public office, the cancellation of her eligibility and forfeiture of her retirement benefits. Graft probers said Gargalicano connived with former mayor Oscar Garin Jr. and other municipal employees in the anomalous procurement of liquid organic fertilizers from Feshan Philippines Inc. amounting to P3 million. Investigation showed no public bidding was conducted and the fertilizer was overpriced by P1,500 per bottle. Former Sorsogon governor Raul Lee is so far the highest local government official convicted over the fertilizer scam. He was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years in prison last August. The Department of Finance said the ombudsman suspended three other officials for various violations. Onofre Natividad, municipal treasurer of South Upi in Maguindanao, was suspended for three months for failing to remit the Pag-IBIG and Government Service Insurance System contributions as well as witholding tax of local government employees from January to December 2007. Eduardo Pagulayan Jr., Bureau of Internal Revenue-Ilocos acting director, was suspended for one month for failing to reinstate Marina de Guzman as regional director. The Court of Appeals reversed an ombudsman ruling dismissing De Guzman in May last year. Meanwhile, Jacinto Villaviray, security guard at the Bureau of Customs, was also suspended for three months by the Civil Service Commission for failing to file his statement of assets, liabilities and net worth for 2014.",

Alleged pedophile Robin Hoyt Alderman, 58, a yoga instructor, reportedly contacted through social media three minors, aged 14 and 15, who were reportedly willing to perform lewd acts with the foreigner. However, law enforcers arrested Alderman upon his arrival at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 2 on Oct. 15 following a tip from the United States Homeland Security after a social media provider informed the US government of Hoyt’s activities. Police charged him with violation of Republic Act 10365 or the Expanded Anti-Human Trafficking Law before the Department of Justice last Oct. 19. Senior Superintendent Villamor Tuliao, who heads the WCPC Anti-Trafficking in Persons Division, said they have the names of the victims, who are from Manila. The online conversation between Alderman and the minors were graphic and showed the girls were willing victims. “What he wants to do with the victims were just like those from ‘50 Shades of Grey,’” Tuliao said. The suspect planned to rent an apartment where he will document their activities. He also told the three minors of his plan to buy a van and a motorcycle, which he will use to abduct homeless children whom he will sexually abuse, Tuliao said. Seized from Alderman’s possession were assorted sex toys, mobile phones, a laptop, face masks and pills. “We have reasons to believe that aside from his sexual perversion, he is also making videos which he will sell,” Tuliao said.              ",

The two new witnesses said their conscience bothered them and they wanted to tell the truth: that Arnaiz’s death was the result of a shootout. “Isipin na din po natin na ginagawa ng mga pulis yung trabaho nila tapos ganyan pa ang mangyayari (Just think that the police officers are just doing their jobs and then this happens),” the female witness said in a television interview over GMA News. The couple, who were riding a tricycle, said they had just dropped off a passenger when they saw two men pursuing a man clad in a black jacket along C-3 Road at around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 18. The male witness claimed the two men, whom he said were police officers, were shouting at the man. The couple said the man in a black jacket pulled out a handgun and shot at the policemen. They hid for 10 minutes until the gunfire subsided. They said it was only in news reports they learned the gunman was Arnaiz. Senior Superintendent Wilson Asueta, who heads the CIDG-NCR, said the two have yet to execute their affidavits. “They will return. We need to further validate and evaluate their statements,” Asueta said in a text message. Arnaiz’s parents filed charges of double murder, torture and planting of evidence against Police Officers 1 Ricky Arquilita and Jeffrey Perez before the Department of Justice (DOJ) for the deaths of Arnaiz and his companion, 14-year-old Reynaldo “Kulot” de Guzman, whose body was found in Nueva Ecija with 28 stab wounds. The policemen sought the dismissal of charges against them in a joint rejoinder affidavit submitted to the DOJ yesterday. They insisted that Arnaiz was killed in a shootout after he allegedly robbed taxi driver Tomas Bagcal along C-3 Road. The policemen reiterated that the incident took place at around 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 18 – contrary to an eyewitness account and forensic exam results that Arnaiz was killed at around 1:30 a.m. Their account, however, was rebutted by the earlier testimony of the eyewitness who said that there was no shootout and Arnaiz even begged for his life when he was shot by the police officers. The DOJ is set to hold a final hearing on Nov. 7 before submitting the case for resolution.",

In a three-page decision dated September 27, the COA Commission Proper has affirmed with finality the Notice of Disallowance issued by its Regional Office VII in May 2013 in connection with the purchase of the personalized calendars. The COA said Chatto and the four other provincial officials filed their joint appeal before Commission Proper nine days beyond the 180-day period provided under the COA rules of procedure, thus the decision of its regional office “shall become final and executory.” While the COA decision did not explicitly identify whose image appears in the calendars, the commission said the purchase was “contrary” to the Department of the Interior and Local Government Memorandum Circular No. 308-97 which urges all local officials “to reflect on their personalized calendars the pictures of their completed projects where human resource development is a major component instead of their pictures.” The COA also cited Administrative Order No. 103 Series of 2004 which suspends the spending on paid media advertisements except for those related to announcement of agency guidelines, rules and regulations, conduct of public bidding or dissemination of important public advisories. The audit body said Bohol government's purchase of the personalized calendars also violated COA Circular No. 85-055-A which prohibits “unnecessary” expenditures or uses of funds and property, including those for “advertisements of anniversaries, etc. in newspapers, TV, or radio merely for publicity or propaganda purposes.” The decision was signed by COA chairman Michael Aguinaldo and commissioners Jose Fabia and Isabel Agito.

Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio will be gunning for a seat at the House of Representatives while Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte announced that he is retiring from politics in 2019. Paolo said that he will go back to farming and focus more on his family as he prepared for retirement. He said that his children were affected by the allegations thrown against him by Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, who accused him of being involved in the smuggling of a P6.4-billion shabu shipment from China. The vice mayor however said there would still be a Carpio-Duterte tandem in the city as the mayor 's husband, lawyer Manases “Mans” Carpio, might run for office. \"When Mayor Sara announced that she will file for a congressional seat in the 1st District, everybody's asking me where I am going. It will still be a Carpio-Duterte tandem in the mayor and vice mayor, we are still talking to the other Duterte, but definitely, it will not be me,\" Paolo said in a release. Paolo said that Carpio is \"very qualified\" to lead Davao City because of his background as a lawyer. Talks are also ongoing with Sebastian \"Baste\" Duterte regarding his plans for the 2019 local polls. Mayor Duterte first made her announcement to seek a congressional post at the launch of the Tapang at Malasakit Alliance for the Philippines in Taguig City on Monday. “I do not have plans of running [for] a national post in the 2019 elections. But I have plans of running in the first congressional district of Davao City,” Sara said Monday to dismiss rumors that she is eyeing a senatorial seat. Rep. Karlo Alexei Nograles, a Duterte ally, is congressman for the 1st District of Davao City.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The parents of Kian Loyd delos Santos yesterday sought the indictment of 12 former Caloocan policemen for the killing of the victim last August. In a preliminary investigation, Saldy and Lorenza delos Santos asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) to charge the additional respondents. They asked the investigating panel of prosecutors to reject the defense of the police officers that they could not be held liable for Kian’s murder. Represented by Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) chief Persida Rueda-Acosta, the complainants said the respondents were part of the police team that allegedly killed Kian in a supposed anti-drug operation in Caloocan on Aug. 16. “The Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Services in its conduct of a motu-propio investigation of the incident, found the respondents liable for the death of Kian,” read the petition. “From the foregoing, the herein respondents cannot deny the fact that the PNP-IAS has ruled out their claim that the operation was legitimate,” it added. The respondents are Police Officers 2 Arnel Canezares, Diony Corpuz and Fernan Cano, and PO1s Reynaldo Dan Blanco Jr., Silverio Garcia Jr., Ronald Herrera, Myrldon Yagi, Christian Joy Aguilar, Ceferino Paculan, J-Rossillini Lorenzo, Erwin Romeroso and Ferdinand Claro. They are facing charges of murder, torture, planting of evidence and violation of domicile under Article 128 of the Revised Penal Code. The panel of prosecutors headed by Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Tofel Austria ordered the respondents to submit their rejoinder tomorrow. Only four police officers were named in the initial complaint. They were Chief Inspector Amor Cerillo, PO3 Arnel Oares and PO1s Jeremiah Pereda and Jerwin Cruz, all former members of the Caloocan police community precinct 7. A total of 16 witnesses have been presented by the National Bureau of Investigation to support the charges against the four. The PAO also submitted to the DOJ closed-circuit television footage and the results of the forensic examination on Kian, which showed that he was lying face down when shot three times.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Following a spike of surrenders last month, at least 48 other New People’s Army (NPA) rebels have yielded to government troops since Oct. 1. On Tuesday, 18 members of the Guerrilla Front 73 in Senator Ninoy Aquino and Kalamansig towns in Sultan Kudarat surrendered on Tuesday. The NPA guerrillas turned over their firearms and four improvised bombs each weighing more than two kilos to the 33rd Infantry Battalion (IB). The rebels were presented to Mayors Randy Ecija and Ronan Garcia of Senator Ninoy Aquino and Kalamansig, respectively, who promised to provide livelihood and relief assistance to the rebel-returnees.   Five of those who surrendered to the 57th IB last week belonged to the Guerrilla Front 53 also based in Kalamansig. The rebels complained of their “difficult life”due to the government’s relentless campaign against communist insurgents and infighting among NPA leaders, Maj. Gen. Arnel dela Vega of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division said yesterday. Col. Edgard Arevalo, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs office chief, said the surrenders affirmed the success of “focused military operations complemented by intelligence and civil-military efforts.” Last Oct. 1, Alex Gawelan, alias Banate, a ranking member of the Guerrilla Front 53, surrendered to the 39th IB in Arakan, North Cotabato. Several NPA guerrillas also surrendered in Abra, Surigao del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley, Occidental Mindoro and Cagayan.  Arevalo said 14 high-powered firearms were recovered from 30 rebels who surrendered from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. Aside from over 400 rebels who surrendered since January, the AFP said 121 were killed in military operations while 71 were arrested. The rebels yielded more than 300 firearms.  The military said it achieved significant gains in the campaign against communist insurgency since peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front were suspended last February. “Our incessant combat, intelligence and civil military operations are now bearing fruit as more and more NPA rebels are now returning to the fold of the law,” AFP chief Gen. Eduardo Año said.",

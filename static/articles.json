            "content": "Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria Sison has accused his former student, President Rodrigo Duterte, of lying about his intention to create a coalition government with communist rebels following the President's decision to scrap peace talks with the rebels. In a statement on his official website and Facebook page, Sison cited a Philippine Daily Inquirer report in December 2014 that said Duterte would seek a coalition with the CPP and Moro National Liberation Front if he is elected president.  Sison, Duterte's former professor, warned that the President is being carried away \"by his obsession to establish a fascist dictatorship through charter change under the pretext of adopting a pseudo-federal system under his overcentralized despotism and terrorism.\" He labeled his former student as a \"consistent political swindler and demagogue who depends heavily on lying.\" He said the problem of illegal drugs has worsened under Duterte \"because his own family is involved in large-scale drug smuggling and his regime protects the biggest drug lords and protectors at the level of governors and generals...\" Duterte has denied allegations that his eldest son, Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte, was part of a Chinese drug triad and is involved in the illegal drug trade.  He earlier said he has ordered authorities to kill his son if he is caught with links to narcotics.  He also said he prefers \"independent agencies\" to investigate his son, Paolo, and son-in-law Manases Carpio over corruption and illegal drug smuggling allegations. Duterte on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the peace talks with the CPP and said he would consider the political arm of the rebels a \"terrorist group.\" He also demanded that dozens of rebel leaders he freed last year in order to restart talks turn themselves in. \"I am ordering those I have released temporarily to surrender or face again punitive action,\" Duterte in a speech to soldiers. \"Let it not be said that I did not try to reach out to them,\" he said. He also warned his former professor not to return to the Philippines or he will have him arrested.  “If Joma comes here, I will arrest him . . . Huwag na siyang bumalik dito. I will not allow him to enter his native land, and that is a painful experience,” Duterte said in a speech during the homecoming celebration of San Beda College of Law. In his statement, Sison criticized Duterte for saying that he will wipe out corruption and then allying himself with the \"Marcoses, Arroyos, Estradas and others to add their bailiwick votes to his own bailiwick vote in order to get 39 percent of the total vote in 2016 elections.\" \"In exchange, Duterte has let them off the hook on the charges of plunder and corruption. He himself has amassed a great amount of undeclared wealth by collecting huge campaign funds in billions of pesos from 2014 to 2016,\" he said.  \"As a president in a rush to become a fascist dictator, he expects to have limitless opportunities for bureaucratic corruption like his idol Marcos, especially in overpriced infrastructure projects, government purchases and cheap sale of raw materials,\" he added.",

Ito ngayon ang isa sa mga napagkukunan ng kuryente ng mga residente sa isla ng Talim sa lalawigan ng Rizal. Karaniwang nakakaranas ng brownout ang mga residente ng isla ng Talim dahil sa madalas na pag-ulang may kasamang malakas na hangin. Nakakapagpatumba ito ng mga poste ng kuryente, na karaniwang inaabot ng dalawang linggo bago maayos dahil sa layo ng lugar. Ang hindi alam ng mga residente, may mapapagkunan sila ng enerhiya sa kanilang bakuran, ang tubig sa Laguna de Bay. Ayon sa Laguna Lake Development Authority, mababa na ang kalidad ng tubig sa lawa dahil sa metal at toxic pollutants dito. Maaari na lamang gamitin ang tubig para sa fishery at recreation activities. Ngunit ang ganitong klase ng tubig ang may ions, isang chemical compound na may electric charge at nakakalikha ng kuryente. Para mapakinabangan ang ions na ito, bumuo ang mga estudyante ng TIP ng submerged battery device na tinatawag na \"Ilawa.\" Gawa ito sa aluminum cutouts mula sa lata ng softrdrinks, activated carbon mula sa water filters na binalot sa net at copper wires. Sa naturang disenyo, nae-expose ang electrodes sa tubig na nagsisilbing electrolyte. Kapag nagkaroon ng chemical reaction ay magkakaroon ng kuryente na magpapailaw sa LED sa device. \"In order to produce chemical reaction, the polluted water has to be exposed to a metal...We chose the aluminum from used soda cans to also encourage recycling,\" paliwanag ni Dranreb Earl Juanico, director ng TIP Research and Development Management Office. Dagdag pa nila, nagamit nila ang maduming tubig sa lawa para makatulong sa mga residente. \"We took something bad and made something good out of it...We used the water pollution in the lake to provide electricity,\" paliwanag ni Juanico. Makatutulong ang naturang imbensiyon hindi lamang para pailawin ang mga bahay at kalsada sa Talim Island dahil magagamit rin ito ng mga mangingisda sa tuwing papalaot sa gabi. Madali rin itong gawin at environment-friendly kumpara sa kerosene at standard na battery-powered light na karaniwang ginagamit ng mga residente.",

The Philippine National Police (PNP) Chaplain handed her the gift last Friday, De Lima said.  \"I cannot thank Pope Francis enough for his thoughtfulness. I’m deeply, deeply touched by the Pope’s gesture,\" De Lima was quoted as saying in a statement from her office. \"This gift will constantly remind me that, despite the political persecution I am experiencing right now at the hands of a vengeful President, I should keep the faith and fight tirelessly for the welfare of the Filipino people.\"  She also described the rosary as \"beautiful\", but gave no other details.  The 58-year-old De Lima is accused of accepting drug money from prisoners when she was justice secretary from 2010 and 2015. She is not entitled to bail and, if found guilty, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  She has denied the allegations, claiming she had been locked up to stop her from criticizing the administration's war on drugs that has seen thousands of suspected criminals killed.   Malacañang has denied that the opposition senator was subjected to political persecution.  The full text of De Lima's letter to Pope Francis reads:  Dear Papa Francesco, I am Leila de Lima, a senator from the Philippines and a political prisoner who has been incarcerated for the past 173 days, by President Rodrigo Duterte. The international community has been appalled by the brazen violation of human rights since Duterte waged his war on drugs. \nThis August 27, I will turn 58 years old. Life's journey has had its ups and downs, but I never imagined that my birthday would be spent inside a jail. Papa Francesco, if I may be granted one wish, I hope that you will say a prayer for me and the Filipino people. Please bless me so I can have the strength to continue the fight against the injustice that is happening not only to me, but to thousands of Filipinos who are victims of extra judicial killing. I do not know when I will regain my freedom. Only Faith sustains me through this nightmare. Please include me and the Philippines in your prayers. God bless you Papa.

            "content": "MANILA - Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre is set to take the witness stand in the impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno this week, the chairperson of the House justice committee said Sunday. Among the grounds in the impeachment complaint was Sereno’s alleged manipulation and delaying of Aguirre's request to transfer the cases against Maute gunmen outside of Mindanao for security reasons. \"Nagpasabi si Secretary Vit Aguirre na sa Martes pa siya available kaya ini-move na rin namin ang kaniyang testimonya,\" Rep. Reynaldo Umali told DZMM. Aguirre wrote to Sereno requesting the transfer the trial of Maute suspects to Luzon or Visayas, but the SC instead moved the venue to either Iligan City or Cagayan de Oro City. The Justice Secretary then wrote a second letter pointing out that the 2 cities were too close to Maute supporters in Marawi City. He also requested that the suspects be detained in Taguig City. The SC later granted his request and transferred Maute suspects to Metro Manila. NO SC JUDGES ON MONDAY HEARING Aside from allegedly delaying Aguirre's request, Sereno is also accused of misdeclaring her wealth, having an extravagant lifestyle and bypassing her colleagues in the issuance of administrative orders. Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo De Castro, who supposedly penned a temporary restraining order that Sereno later \"tampered with,\" have been invited to testify in the hearing, together with other SC magistrates and court personnel. The group however needs permission to join the proceedings from the SC en banc, which would not meet until Tuesday, said Umali. \"Ang en banc nila sa Martes pa kaya baka hindi natin maassahang dumating ang Supreme Court justices at probably, mga court personnel [sa Lunes],\" he said. (The en banc is scheduled on Tuesday so we may not expect SC justices and probably, court personnel, to attend on Monday.) Sereno has denied the allegations and refused to attend the impeachment hearings, saying her lawyers can question witnesses on her behalf. House leaders however said this was against the rules of procedure, which state that only resource persons are allowed to speak, and not their lawyers.",

The marriage this week of the grandchildren of former president Ferdinand Marcos and former senator Raul Manglapus signals the end of a decades-long rivalry, Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos said Saturday. \"Many years ago my father was . . . gravely disappointed and saddened by the (loss) to the Supreme Court in his right to travel back home. That is the Supreme Court case Marcos vs. Manglapus,\" Marcos said during a thanksgiving celebration of the wedding of her son, lawyer Ferdinand Michael Manotoc, to Carina Amelia Manglapus. \"Tonight we have reversed that miserable ruling . . . Cara joining our family, love wins.\" Manotoc and Manglapus' wedding on Wednesday was held privately in Makati. On Saturday, Laoag Bishop Renato Mayugba presided over a thanksgiving mass held at Paoay church. Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu, presidential adviser Francis Tolentino, and presidential spokesman Harry Roque were in attendance. Ilocos Norte Rep. Imelda Marcos said: \"I'm very, very happy today because two families that are in contrast for so many years suddenly fell in love.\" Ferdinand Marcos won the 1965 presidential election over Raul Manglapus, who later became one of the pro-democracy opposition leaders based in the US. Manglapus served as the foreign affairs secretary of former President Cory Aquino.  Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, meanwhile, thanked the Marcos family for helping her father President Rodrigo Duterte during the 2016 elections. The mayor said she's also grateful that some of the wedding gifts will be donated for the rehabilitation of Marawi City. — With reports from Kim Lorenzo, ABS-CBN News",

            "timestamp": "Nov 26 2017 12:47 AM",
            "content": "MANILA—Sen. JV Ejercito on Saturday said he hopes Sumitomo Corp. will return as maintenance provider for the MRT-3. “Ang maintenance provider will be crucial. Now that (undersecretary) Cesar (Chavez) is gone, I’m hoping that, call me biased, pero ako talagang Sumitomo . . . I’m hoping that Sumitomo comes back. Kasi unang-una, sabi nga natin reputable Japanese company,” Ejercito, chairman of the Senate committee on urban planning, housing and resettlement, told radio DZMM. “Pangalawa, sila na iyong nanggaling na rito. May experience na, they have an idea or knowledge already of the MRT system. So ako siguro that’s the immediate [solution], if you can convince Sumitomo to come back.” The MRT-3 has been in hot water lately for increasing passenger offloads and an incident involving two train cars being detached from one another. Chavez on Thursday resigned as transportation undersecretary for rail and said he was taking responsibility for the train incidents. Ejercito added that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) should get a maintenance provider that invests on spare parts.  “Ang kailangan mo dyan, alam iyong sistema. Pangalawa, iyong mag-i-invest on spare parts. Palagay ko iyon ang magiging problema. Itong mga nanalong maintenance providers after Sumitomo, they did not invest on spare parts,” he said. A check with spare-parts supplier Bombardier showed that \"not a single\" part was procured from the company since 2013, according to Chavez. Ejercito, meanwhile, said he is still hopeful that emergency powers will be given to President Duterte to address the country's traffic problem. “Ako gusto ko pa rin talaga maipasa ito. Unang-una, projects that will fall under the emergency powers will have the exemption from (temporary restraining orders). But to have check and balance, only the Supreme Court can issue a TRO,” he said. However, the Senate has yet to approve Senate Bill No. 1284, which grants Duterte emergency powers, because the DOTr has yet to present its plans to solve the traffic situation, according to Ejercito. “I understand also iyong dilemma, if you want detailed engineering plans, medyo matagal iyan. That would take about 6 months up to 1 year. Probably that’s one of the reasons bakit hindi makapagbigay talaga ang DOTr,” he said. In a statement, Sen. Grace Poe called on Malacañang to certify SB 1284 as urgent. \"Siguradong gagalaw ang emergency powers kung gagawin ng Malacañang na prayoridad ito at sesertipikahan para rin makatulong sa mabilis na pagpapatupad ng mga proyektong magpapaginhawa sa trapik,\" the statement read. The DOTr earlier this month terminated its maintenance contract with Busan Universal Rail Inc., a Filipino-Korean consortium, tapped by the previous government. The government's contract with Sumitomo expired in 2012.",

Lumalabas sa imbestigasyon na aksidenteng nahukay at nabutas ng backhoe ng 1827 Construction Company ang bakanteng gasoline tank at valve nito. Napag-alaman ding may residue pa ng gasolina ang tangke kaya kumalat ang fumes. Sumiklab ang sunog matapos masagap ng fumes ang apoy mula sa pinaglulutuan ng 34 anyos na tindero ng fish ball na si Raymond Cabe. Nagtamo ng third degree burns si Cabe sa buong katawan at ayon sa mga doktor, naka-life support na lang ito. Nadamay din ang 70 anyos na balut vendor na si Bonifacio Base at kailangan pang operahan sa baga. Parehong nasa intensive care unit ng Victor R. Potenciano Medical Center ang dalawang vendor.

A witness said two motorcycles surrounded Rupinta's vehicle during the attack. Recovered from Largo were his supposed getaway motorcycle, a .45-caliber pistol and a 9-mm pistol, and sachets of suspected drugs.

Inamin naman ng suspek ang kaniyang kasalanan at sinabing bukod sa ginagawa niya ito pandagdag kita, libangan din daw niya ang loteng. Dinepensahan naman ang suspek ng kaniyang misis at sinabing hindi ilegal ang ginagawa ng asawa dahil nagpapataya talaga ito ng lehitimong EZ2.  Sumailalim na sa inquest proceedings ang suspek. --Ulat ni Jasmin Romero, ABS-CBN News",

So far, there are no Filipinos reported among the casualties. According to Ambassador Leslie Baja, the attack took place at the Al-Rawdah mosque in Bir Al-Abed Province, about 300 kilometers northeast of Cairo.\n \nAmbassador Baja said the attack involved at least one suicide bomber and several gunmen who targeted Sufi Muslim worshipers attending Friday afternoon prayers. \n \nMeanwhile, the embassy reminded the 5,183 registered Filipinos of its previous advisories cautioning them from going to the Northern Sinai Region because of the high risk of terrorist attacks. ",

            "timestamp": "Nov 25 2017 08:55 AM",
            "content": "MANILA - \"Life in Marawi was quiet and peaceful. I awoke every day at the sound of the adhan (Muslim call to prayer), to the astonishing view of Lake Lanao, and with a breeze of cold, fresh air.\" Such is the memory of Asmenah Manabilang Barambangan, 24, of her home city in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao before Islamic State-inspired terrorists infiltrated it six months ago, triggering a five-month-long battle with government forces. Barambangan, a law student in Manila who grew up in the predominantly Muslim city, said its cool weather, lush environment and simplicity is what likely enticed many people to settle there. Another native, 16-year-old high school student Aklimah Lao Batao, said separately, \"It's a city where multicultural differences are respected, and is a living proof that religious tolerance is very achievable.\" The thriving city of over 200,000 people had an economy largely based on agriculture and trading, and its peace was only disrupted by the occasional gunfight related to clan wars. That all changed on May 23 when hundreds of Islamist militants seized control of parts of the city, including its commercial center, and the fighting since then, including military airstrikes, has left it devastated. Batao vividly recalls that initial day of the conflict when around nine fighters -- either militants or prison inmates who had been set free -- briefly entered their house that night. \"Everyone was flustered, others started to cry. Thank God, they left,\" he said. As the battle raged on, the city was left deserted. Residents were forced to leave not just their homes, but also abandon their livelihoods. Students stopped going to school. Even residents of nearby towns evacuated for safety. In all, some 360,000 people were displaced, among which some 70,000 have been allowed to return home. By the time the battle ended last month, 170 soldiers and policemen, and 50 civilians had been killed. The insurgency's key leaders -- Isnilon Hapilon of the extremist Abu Sayyaf Group and Omarkhayam Maute of the allied Maute Group -- were among the nearly 1,000 militants who died. Parts of the city, including its commercial center, were reduced to rubble. Barambangan said that seeing the destruction \"gives the sense of loss to everyone.\" \"It is not about the properties damaged, but knowing that Marawi will always bring the memory of war and will never be the same again,\" she said. Barambangan showed video footage showing her family's house hit by a bomb and engulfed in flames. \"We have to start from scratch and rebuild our lives completely...It will take time, probably years, for our city to be habitable. Yet, we will be patient to come back home, as it is our only home,\" she said. Batao said he feels his \"entire identity crashed to the ground as well\" when he saw the results of the war in photos. \"The places I used to go to are now mere soil on the ground,\" he said. \"Aside from government's declaration in late October that full-fledged rehabilitation of Marawi had commenced, the private sector also committed to contribute to the city's rebuilding and rehabilitation \"to help bring back security and a vibrant economy as soon as possible.\" On Nov. 10, several nongovernment organizations and private companies launched the \"United For Marawi\" consortium, gathering pledges from various entities to engage in land surveys of affected areas, provision of educational assistance, and putting up of innovative street lamps, among others. The government plans to flatten all structures in worst affected areas and build new infrastructure including highways, underground electric cables, and a lakeside promenade. \"We can use our core expertise in critical infrastructure such as telecommunications, water, power, fuel and energy, roads, and hospitals, and even sewage plants to help the city continue to deliver basic and lifeline services,\" Rene Meily of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation said at the event. The private sector, Meily said, can \"jumpstart and reinvigorate the local economy by ensuring the continuous flow of goods and services in and out of the city and neighboring areas.\" Pending the completion of the government's post-conflict assessment which will set the required amount to rebuild Marawi, the city's mayor Majul Usman Gandamra said the initial required cost for the rebuilding of Marawi is 90 billion pesos (over $1.7 billion) \"to make it better than before.\" A comprehensive rehabilitation plan is expected to be available by next March. While thousands of houses, both temporary and permanent, will be provided by government and some private donors to some residents, financial assistance will be extended to those who can build their own houses on lots they own. \"There is a commitment on the part of Task Force Bangon Marawi that in rebuilding Marawi, government will consider the religious beliefs and conviction of the residents of Marawi,\" said Harry Roque, spokesman of President Rodrigo Duterte. \"The goal is to completely rebuild Marawi during the term of President Duterte (until 2022),\" he added. Barambangan said she prays that as the government, private sector and international community work to rehabilite her city, \"we will not be stripped of our identity as Maranaos,\" as the local people are known. She said the rebuilding process should take account of the city's original character, art and history, while respecting and preserving its residents' traditional way of living and customs. Batao, for his part, said, \"I want the city to emerge as a place that can compete with other developed cities and provide the needs of its people, and still uphold its values and culture. Although Barambangan, Batao and their family members remain unable to return to Marawi, their hope to eventually do so remains very much alive. \"My entire family and I consider Marawi as our only home,\" Barambangan said.",

May backhoe naman sa gasolinahan dahil sa ginagawang renovation dito. “Nagkataon po na may fishball vendor na malapit, so open flame po ‘yun so ayun po, hinigop niya, so doon po nag-start ang fire,” ayon kay Insp. Francia Embalsado, chief for operations ng BFP Mandaluyong. Kuwento naman ng isang testigo, nakakita rin sila ng mga nagwe-welding sa bubong ng gasolinahan bago ang pagsabog, na posibleng nakadagdag pa sa sunog.  Lumayo na ang testigo nang makaamoy ng gasolina. Tatlo ang nasugatan sa insidente kabilang na ang fishball vendor, backhoe driver, at isang magbabalot. Idineklara rin namang fire out na nitong 5:22 ng hapon.  LOOK: Sunog sa isang gasolinahan sa Bgy.

Ayon naman kay SFO2 Danilo Yumol ng Mandaluyong Fire Station, pasado 5PM sumiklab ang apoy. pic.twitter.com/yRmXav1kHq  Wala pang humarap sa media na tagapagsalita ng gasolinahan pero ayon sa BFP, nasa ospital na sila para alalayan ang mga biktima.  Sa pamamagitan naman ng Department of Energy (DOE) Oil Industry Management Bureau, nagpadala na si Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi ng technical team para mag-imbestiga at alamin kung may pagkukulang ang management ng gasolinahan. Inirekomenda ng technical team na ikansela muna ang certificate of compliance ng gasolinahan. Ibig sabihin, hindi muna puwedeng mag-operate ang gasolinahan hangga’t hindi sumusunod sa retail rules ng DOE. Agad maglalabas ng final report ang technical team kapag natapos na ang kanilang imbestigasyon at ayon sa DOE, hindi sila mag-aatubili na parusahan ang gasolinahan kapag napatunayang mayroong paglabag o pagkukulang.  WATCH: Fire along Shaw Blvd., Mandaluyong City near Wack Wack Road.

            "content": "The Philippine National Police Internal Affairs Service (PNP-IAS) will no longer issue a decision related to the administrative case filed against the Caloocan police officers allegedly involved in the killing of Kian delos Santos.  This comes after the Office of the Ombudsman took over delos Santos’ case.  On August 25, the PNP-IAS was subpoenaed by the Ombudsman to submit documents such as charge sheets, position papers, investigation reports, decisions and other documents related to the investigation of police suspects.  During that time, the PNP-IAS already conducted a pre-charge investigation.  “Hindi po namin binigay sa kanila dahil meron po kaming binigay na timeline sa Senate hearing on Kian's case na tatapusin ko ang kaso bago mag-katapusan ng October,\" PNP-IAS Inspector General Alfegar Triambulo said. He said there is a law that states exclusive jurisdiction to the body handling the investigation.  “Meron tayong nasa batas na Section 52 na Republic Act 451 na tungkol sa principle of exclusivity of the jurisdiction kung sino po ang unang nag-take cognizance sa kaso to the exclusion of the other,\" he said. \"Kaya para mabigyan ng due process po ang mga respondent, isa lang po ang maglilitis para makapag-concentrate sila ng depensa isang disciplinary authority lang.” The Ombudsman, meanwhile, said it has jurisdiction over cases against high-ranking officials. “Please be informed that Police Chief Superintendent Robert Fajardo, Senior Superintendent Chito Bersaluna, P/C Insp. Amor Cerillo, PO3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremias Pereda and PO1 Jerwin Cruz are respondents for grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty for the alleged killing of Kian delos Santos, now pending administrative adjudication before this Office docketed as OMB-P-A-17-0410,\" the document read.  “Pursuant to its mandate to give priority to complaints filed against high-ranking officers and to cases involving grave offenses, this Office shall assume full and exclusive administrative jurisdiction over the above-named respondents,” it continued. Triambulo, however, said his group has jurisdiction over the policemen due to a memorandum of agreement between the National Police Commission and the Ombudsman. “Nakita namin na ang isinasampang kaso na iyon ay initiated by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines noong September 4. So ngayon nauna po iyong aming na-docket doon sa kanila, mas earlier, therefore, kami dapat ang magproseso,\" he said. \"Kino-quote namin under the exclusivity of jurisdiction, kino-quote namin iyong memorandum of agreement between the Napolcom and Ombudsman. Ang hinahawakan lang po lang nila na kaso ay graft and corruption.\"  However, the PNP-IAS decided to give up jurisdiction over the case even if it was ready to file administrative cases against the police suspects.  “Ang IAS kasi ay PNP, para maalis iyong agam-agam na ma-whitewash ang kaso dahil PNP po unit din ang nag-imbestiga samantalang ang Ombudsman ay hindi sakop ng PNP, so para transparency at saka meron din kasing nakalagay sa batas ng IAS na makipagtulungan sa Ombudsman, kaya ninanais ko na i-turnover na lang ang paglilitis ng kaso sa kanila,” Triambulo said. ",

Sa pagdiriwang ng traditional and alternative care month, sinabi ng PITAHC na kabilang ang ear acupuncture at homeopathy sa ginagawan nila ng pag-aaral katuwang ang National Detoxification Acupuncture Association (NADA). \"Ear acupuncture ay for detoxification to relieve the symptoms of drugs...[With] the use of natural air, water, food, exercise and the right amount of sleep, we will see if there will be a drop once we employ this in the community,\" paliwanag ni Dr. Annabelle Pabiona de Guzman, director general ng PITAHC.  Isa si alyas \"Tony\" sa mga masuwerteng maagang nagbenepisyo sa ear acupuncture na isinagawa sa ilang mga drug surrenderee sa Brgy. Culiat, Quezon City.  Tatlumpung taong nalulong sa shabu si Tony, na 23 anyos nang unang makatikim ng droga. \"Simula nung natusok ako sa acupuncture gumaan at guminhawa pakiramdam ko...Maganda kasi lahat ng toxin sa katawan namin naalis,\" ani Tony.

Nangunguna ang shabu, pangalawa ang marijuana sa mga sinasabing pinakaginagamit ng mga na-admit sa rehab centers. Bukas naman ang chairman ng DDB sa planong pag-aaral. \"Baka 'yan pala din ang isa sa mga sagot kaya natin pag-aaralan...If it's okay ia-adopt natin 'yan para it can help sa ating kampanya,\" ani Benjamin Reyes, chairman ng DDB.

            "timestamp": "Nov 24 2017 10:25 PM",
            "content": "MANILA- United Nations human rights experts called on the Philippine government to end killings under President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign. A joint statement released Thursday, Nov. 23, by UN special rapporteurs Agnes Callamard, Michel Forst and Diego García-Sayán urged the government to introduce measures to stop attacks and killings under Duterte's war on drugs and bring perpetrators to justice. \"We call on the Government to urgently introduce appropriate measures to stop these attacks and killings being carried out,” the experts said. “The Philippines is required to protect its population, and its Government has a positive obligation to take effective measures to protect the right to life. Failure to do so is a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" they added. The administration has repeatedly defended the drug war, saying the more than 3,900 drug suspects killed in police operations since July 1, 2016 had put up violent resistance, prompting officers to defend themselves. More than 2,000 homicide cases have been found to be drug-related.  Earlier this week, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called out President Duterte for his threats against Callamard. Malacañang responded by telling Callamard not to come to the Philippines uninvited. Callamard had earlier sought to visit the Philippines to look into the country's human rights situation but later on rejected an invitation from the government as it comes with conditions, such as holding a public debate with the President. \"A great number of new cases\" including killings of men, women, and children have also been reported to the UN experts, many of which they said \"appear to be perpetrated by law enforcement officials and by unknown assailants.\" The UN experts also expressed concerns that the exact number of victims is unknown given the changes in terminology and conflicts in official reporting.  They also called upon the government to conduct prompt and effective investigations into the killings and to give access to information to relatives of victims. “For an investigation to be effective, it must be conducted promptly. It must be impartial and independent, it should lead to holding perpetrators accountable, and relatives must be involved,” they said. The rapporteurs said they have raised their concerns to the government and have offered assistance to protect human rights in the Philippines. 'BIASED INDIVIDUALS' Malacañang, meanwhile, slammed the UN rapporteurs’ joint statement, calling the three \"biased individuals\" who were \"concocting falsehoods\" to \"bully States.\" Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque in a statement reiterated that the government does not condone extrajudicial and vigilante killings, and does not tolerate human rights violations as well. \"Even as we continue to respect the UN Special Procedures mechanism, we will not allow these biased individuals parading themselves as human rights experts to abuse such a mechanism to bully States by concocting falsehoods,\" Roque said on Friday. \"We reiterate that the current administration does not - and will never - condone extrajudicial and vigilante killings and does not tolerate human rights violations,\" he added. Roque cited the relief of the entire Caloocan Police District from service following violations in the conduct of police operations, as an example that the government probes and punishes erring policemen. \"We believe that accountability is an indispensable part of good governance and the President himself made a clear stance that legitimate operations follow protocols,\" he said. \"We therefore decry the Special Rapporteurs who signed the joint statement for making negative assumptions about the country despite our explanations to the contrary,\" he added.",

            "timestamp": "Nov 24 2017 10:10 PM",
            "content": "MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founding chairman Jose Maria Sison can forget about returning to the Philippines, as peace talks between the government and the communist rebels collapsed. “If Joma comes here, I will arrest him . . . Huwag na siyang bumalik dito. I will not allow him to enter his native land, and that is a painful experience,” Duterte said in a speech during the homecoming celebration of San Beda College of Law. Sison, Duterte’s former professor, has been in exile in The Netherlands since 1987. The president made this remark as he urged the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) peace consultants, who were earlier granted conditional release to participate in the peace talks, to surrender or face re-arrest. He admitted he felt grumblings within the military following his decision to seek the temporary release of the NDFP consultants, including CPP leaders Benito and Wilma Tiamzon. But he said he had to stop peace talks with the rebels because the latter has “done so much destruction to the country.” Duterte had sought to end the nearly 50-year communist insurgency early in his term, even appointing leftists to his Cabinet as a demonstration of the two sides' warming ties. “I said, well let it not be said I did not try to reach out to them, for after all, during the campaign, my promise to the people of the Philippines was that I would suppress corruption in government and I’m hell bent on doing it,” Duterte said in an earlier speech Friday at Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan. Government officials and NDF negotiators had 4 rounds of talks in Europe, where Sison is based, before Duterte suspended the negotiations last May. The talks, however, were stalled following armed clashes between government troops and communist guerrillas.  Duterte's anger against the communists was also reignited following the death of a 4-month-old girl who was hit by a stray bullet in a rebel ambush in Bukidnon earlier this month. In his speech Friday, the president said one of the reasons he terminated talks with the communist rebels is the latter’s supposed goal to form a coalition government with his administration. “I cannot give you what I don’t have and it is a portion of a sovereignty which nobody can own except the Filipino people,” he said. He, nonetheless, lamented the collapse of the peace talks, saying “I’m the only one na pwede nilang kausapin at this time of the national life.” SISON: DUTERTE MENTALLY UNFIT TO LEAD PH Since the government’s decision to terminate peace talks with the communists, Sison has released several statements lamenting the decision. In a statement released Friday, Sison explained how Duterte “sabotaged” the peace talks. “Duterte spouted lies like the NDFP ignored the GRP (Government of the Republic of the Philippines) proposal for a stand down agreement prior to the adoption and implementation of the coordinated unilateral ceasefire. Showing gross ignorance of the peace process, he even referred to The Netherlands as the facilitator rather than the Royal Norwegian Government,” Duterte said. “There are symptoms that Duterte is mentally unfit to handle the complexities of the affairs of his state and the peace process between the GRP and NDFP. GRP officials in his Cabinet and the reactionary armed forces should consider whether he is mentally fit for his office or needs to be replaced in accordance with their 1987 Constitution.” In a previous statement, Sison called Duterte the “number one terrorist in the Philippines”, after the Chief Executive said he would declare the NPA, the CPP’s armed wing, as a terrorist group, and order the arrest of members of communist “legal fronts.” “He is culpable for the abduction, torture and mass murder of an increasing large number of poor people suspected drug users and pushers, peasants and indigenous people in suspected guerrilla fronts and Moro people suspected of aiding the Dawlah Islamiyah from the time of the indiscriminate bombing of Marawi City to the present in several Bangsamoro areas,” Sison said. “Duterte's bloodlust and mania for mass murder are boundless. He expects to wipe out through arbitrary arrests, torture, indefinite detention and massacre of suspected revolutionaries and legal social activists both the armed revolutionary movement and the legal democratic movement in order to set up a fascist dictatorship in the service of US imperialism and his fellow oligarchs among the big compradors, landlords and corrupt bureaucrats.”",

Nahaharap sila sa patong-patong na kaso sa paglabag ng Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, Cybercrime Prevention Act, Anti-Child Pornography Act, at Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act.  Maaari rin silang makulong nang habambuhay. -- Ulat ni Niko Baua, ABS-CBN News",

Nakuhanan pa ng dash cam ng isang motorista ang pagsalisi ng grupo sa babaeng negosyante sa parking lot ng isang ospital sa Pasay. Kita sa video ang pagdating ng isang puting SUV na naghahanap ng mapaparadahan.  Maya-maya pa, nilapitan ng grupo ang sasakyan at kinatok ng isang lalaki ang bintana ng kotse habang itinuturo ang barya at susi na nahulog umano mula sa SUV. Hindi alam ng biktima na may nag-aabang na isa pang lalaki sa kabilang pinto ng SUV. Agad binuksan ng nag-aabang na lalaki ang pinto nang bumaba ang babae, saka tinangay ang bag ng biktima.  Nagpulasan din agad ang mga suspek pagkakuha ng bag kabilang na ang tatlong babaeng nagsilbi umanong lookout ng grupo. Ayon kay Supt. Gene Licud ng Pasay City police, nasa P1.7 milyon ang halaga na nakuha ng suspek kabilang na ang mamahaling bag, relo, cash, at alahas.  Dagdag pa ng Pasay City police, target ng grupo ang mga babaeng mag-isang nagmamaneho at may dalang gamit sa loob ng sasakyan. Ang mga babaeng kasabwat ng grupo, ang tagaturo ng target. Nagsisilbi rin silang lookout ng grupo at tagatakip para walang makakita sa pagnanakaw.\r\n    \r\nBase rin anila sa kuha ng dash cam, planado at organisado ang grupo. Isa sa kanila ang kakatok sa kotse ng biktima at may miyembro na tatakip sa bystander. Inaalam na ng pulisya ang pagkakakilanlan ng anim na suspek na nahagip ng dash cam. Kabilang dito ang mga lalaking lumapit at tumangay sa gamit ng biktima, at ang tatlong babaeng kasama nila.  Pinag-aaralan na rin ang hawak nilang CCTV kung may iba pang sangkot sa modus. Pinag-iingat naman ng pulisya ang publiko sa mga katulad na modus lalo na ngayong papalapit ang Pasko.\r\n    \r\nSa sinumang nakakita o nakakakilala sa mga suspek na tinutugis ng pulisya, maaaring ipagbigay-alam ang anumang impormasyon tungkol sa kanila sa Pasay City police sa kanilang hotline number na 0998-598-7922. -- Ulat ni Raffy Santos, ABS-CBN News",

            "content": "MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said he will “think about resignation” if he will not be able to control narcotics in the Philippines. “I cannot accept. I simply cannot accept it. And if I cannot control drugs, then maybe it is time for me to think about resignation,” Duterte said in a speech in Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan.  “‘Pag hindi ko kaya ito, bababa talaga ako. Sabihin ko sa inyo.” Duterte had promised to solve the country’s drug problem within 3 to 6 months when he assumed power in mid-2016. He, however, later dropped this target, saying he only realized the magnitude of the drug problem when he became president. Duterte has been criticized here and abroad for his war on drugs, where over 3,900 have been killed in presumed-legitimate police operations since July 1, 2016, according to police statistics. Officials said slain drug suspects had put up violent resistance. The administration has also repeatedly asserted that it does not sanction summary killings nor condone police abuses. Duterte talked about a possible resignation and also announced he would soon put the police back at the forefront of the war on drugs, over a month after assigning the task to the much smaller Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). “I have not yet signed the executive order, but I’m inclined to call back the police and join again in the drug war,” Duterte said in a speech in Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan. Duterte’s plan, however, has been criticized by human rights groups and opposition lawmakers, saying the issues hounding the police force’s enforcement of the anti-illegal drugs campaign have yet to be resolved.",

            "content": "MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday asked National Democratic Front (NDF) consultants to surrender after calling off peace talks with communist rebels.  Some 20 NDF consultants were granted conditional release so they could participate in the peace talks, which were revived after Duterte, a self-proclaimed socialist, came to power in mid-2016.  But now that the peace talks have fallen through, Duterte said the peace consultants must now surrender. “Now, I will consider the movement of the Communist Party of the Philippines as a terrorist group and I am ordering those I have released temporarily to surrender or face again punitive actions. You have to go back where you belong. I released you because I thought it might help,” Duterte said in a speech in Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan. “Eh kung hindi makatulong, then you are undercutting me before the eyes of the Filipino people, ah you must be joking. You must be joking because I will go after you. And I do not really care whatever happens thereafter.” Duterte on Thursday signed Proclamation No. 360 formally terminating peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) of the Philippines, following continued attacks by the New People’s Army (NDF) on state troops.  Duterte, a former student of Communist Party of the Philippines founding chairman Jose Maria Sison, had sought to end the nearly 50-year communist insurgency early in his term, even appointing leftists to his Cabinet as a demonstration of the two sides' warming ties. “I said, well let it not be said I did not try to reach out to them, for after all, during the campaign, my promise to the people of the Philippines was that I would suppress corruption in government and I’m hell bent on doing it,” he said. Government officials and NDFP negotiators had 4 rounds of talks in Europe, where Sison is based, before Duterte suspended the negotiations last May. The talks were stalled following armed clashes between government troops and communist guerrillas.  Duterte's anger against the communists was reignited following the death of a 4-month-old girl who was hit by stray bullet in a rebel ambush in Bukidnon earlier this month.",

It also directs the Talibon RTC to transfer the kidnapping and serious illegal detention case against the mayor's husband, primary suspect Bohol board member Niño Rey Boniel, and his alleged cohorts, to the Cebu RTC. The SC resolution granted Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre's request to consolidate the criminal charges filed against the accused so that both parties can easily track the progress of the cases. Lawyer Amando Ligutan, the complainant's counsel, said they can now expect a speedy trial of those accused. Angela Leyson, complainant and good friend of the slain mayor, welcomed the move.  \"I'm actually very, very happy. It's a nightmare na baka may nakasunod sa amin. I'm looking forward that justice will be served,\" she said. The pre-trial conference of the case has been suspended pending the petition for review submitted by the respondent before the Department of Justice. Lawyer Inocencio dela Cerna, one of the respondent's counsels, said this was not a victory yet for the complainant and the transfer of venue will not weaken their defense. A separate parricide case was earlier filed against Niño Rey and 8 others and is now being handled by the Cebu RTC. The town mayor was allegedly thrown off a boat in Caubian Island after her husband allegedly shot her dead on June 7.",

Pero nababalot ng takot ang mga katutubong Molbog na nakatira malapit sa ilog sa Brgy. Catagupan sa bayan ng Balabac dahil sa pagsalakay ng buwaya. Pinakahuling sinakmal ng buwaya noong Nobyembre 9 ang isang 12 anyos na bata habang papatawid ito sa tulay kasama ang kaniyang nakababatang kapatid. Ayon sa kapatid, tinangay ng buwaya sa ilog ang biktima, na humihingi pa ng saklolo. \"Malaki po at maitim na buwaya, dinala niya si ate,\" kuwento ng kapatid na nakaligtas sa insidente. Ayon sa ina ng magkapatid, makailang ulit na niya silang pinaalalahanan na mag-ingat sa pagtawid sa tulay dahil doon nagtatago ang buwaya.  Hanggang ngayon ay hindi pa rin mahanap ang bata pero umaasa ang pamilya na makikita kahit ang katawan lang ng paslit. Kaya't kahit delikado ay sinusuyod pa rin nila ang ilog sa Sitio Tukanigalo sa nasabing lugar. Gayunpaman, hindi pa rin matanggap ng mga magulang ang sinapit ng anak kaya bilang ganti ay isang dalawang metrong buwaya ang kanilang hinuli at pinatay. Buwaya, 'naistorbo' ng ilegal na akitibidad  Kasama ang Palawan Council for Sustainable Development, Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center at iba pang ahensiya, sinurvey ang ilog ng Sitio Tukanigalo.  Kalmado ang ilog pero malabo ang tubig. Mainam daw itong tirahan ng mga hayop lalo na ng mga buwaya dahil sa yabong ng bakawan.  Pero hindi inaasahan ang eksenang bumungad sa grupo.  Mahigit isang ektaryang pinagpuputol na bakaw na ginamit sa tanbarking o pagbabalat ng bakaw ang natagpuan ng grupo. Malaki ang posibilidad na ang ilegal na aktibidad ang dahilan ng pag-atake ng buwaya. Hinintay ng grupo na dumilim para gawin ang night spotting na bahagi ng validation. Doon nakumpirmang mayroon ngang dambuhalang buwaya ang nakatira sa ilog. Makikita rin ang pagiging agresibo at dominante ng buwaya na maaaring nagbabantay ng kaniyang teritoryo. Sa tantiya ng mga eksperto, nasa 14 talampakan ang buwaya. Maaari raw na maulit pa ang pag-atake kung patuloy na aabusuhin ng mga tao ang kanilang tirahan. Bubuo pa rin ng rekomendasyon ang grupo para magkaroon ng desisyon kung huhulihin ang buwaya o mismong ang mga tao na ang lumayo sa natural na tirahan ng mga buwaya.\n ",

            "content": "MANILA - The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Friday said it will closely monitor the return of the police force as the lead agency in the war on drugs. The commission, which President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly called out for criticizing his narcotics crackdown, \"will monitor all actions taken,\" said Gascon. \"The President as chief executive is required to enforce the laws but when he does so, he must always comply with the constitution and established human rights standards,\" CHR Chairman Chito Gascon told reporters at an Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) forum. \"We in the CHR will not tell him what he should or should not do. We will inform him as well as other members of the administration when we see that they transgress human rights standards which he is also obliged to uphold and defend,\" he added. He added, whether Duterte's actions are lawful or unlawful will be determined \"in the course of appropriate proceedings.\" \"The CHR is mandated to monitor all forms of human rights violations as they occur in the last 18 month. In the course of the administration's war on drugs, we have monitored violations and we have called this out, whether it was the police or later transferred to PDEA and now re-transferred back to police,\" he said. IBP President Adiel Elijah Fajardo said there are pending motions before the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to stop police force's \"Oplan Double Barrel.\" \"Kung sinabi ng SC ay invalid, unconstitutional, therefore illegal, mawawalan ng basis ang PNP to take the lead,\" he said. He added, his reading of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act says the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency must be the lead agency in its enforcement and the Dangerous Drugs Board in policy-creation. \"Police, NBI et cetera, are just support organizations, from the reading of the law are support lang,\" he said. The IBP and the CHR have signed a partnership so that CHR can refer victims of families of apparent extra judicial killings to the IBP for free legal assistance. Fajardo said IBP noticed that the justice system has been overloaded with cases related to the drug war, which have in turn made the dispensation of justice slower.  \"Napansin namin talagang ang court system talagang overloaded na. Kasi nga, imagine mo halimbawa thousands of apprehensions thousands of those cases to be heard to be processed and prosecuted. Lahat naapektuhan, pati civil cases, maapektuhan sa scheduling…konti korte triple mo load nila because of the drug cases,\" he said. He added, it also became apparent how dockets of the court as well as the prosecution services \"have ballooned for the past year or so because of the ongoing campaign against illegal substances.\" \"This is alarming because the quality of the justice we dispense might suffer if there is just so many cases and the infrastructure of the judiciary as well as the DOJ cannot cope with the demand for justice,\" he said. The IBP, he said, is looking forward to partnering with the CHR for a referral system and be able to assist the families who cannot afford to have the services of a private counsel. Gascon added, there had been many different human rights violations happening amid the government's war on drugs, not only extrajudicial killings. He cited, there had been incidents of arbitrary detention, torture, and enforced disappearances. CHR was investigating 946 cases involving 1151 victims related to the war on drugs, 521 of which are on police operations while 425 are on alleged vigilante killings. Gascon said he was also concerned at the pervading sense of impunity in the country even as he called on government to cooperate with human rights defenders. \"Our cause of concern is primarily the sense of impunity that has pervaded the country where violations occur and no one is held to account,\" he said. \"We have asked for the cooperation of the police in our investigations and continue to expect the government to respond accordingly to this request for cooperation,\" he added. Gascon said they have asked the police to give them all the case folders of all cases of deaths arising from the war on drugs, but \"they have not turned over any of these case folders to the commission, even though we are constitutionally mandated to monitor and investigate possible cases of violations.\" \"Whether its the PNP or any law enforcement agency that will pursue these efforts of the war on drugs of the administration, we will just continue to do our part as we expect them to do their part in terms of assisting us in ensuring the public is reassured that no human rights violations are occurring,\" he said.",

Duterte’s plan to lift police anti-narcotics operations attracted criticism from human rights groups and opposition lawmakers, saying the issues hounding the police force’s enforcement of the anti-illegal drugs campaign have yet to be resolved. Duterte issued on October 10 a memorandum circular ordering the 2,000-strong Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to take the lead in the anti-drug campaign just as the roughly 175,000-strong PNP faced allegations of abuse in the drug war. The President’s decision was made amid growing criticism against the PNP following the spate of teenager deaths in anti-drug raids in Metro Manila. The October order prompted the PNP to terminate the controversial \"Oplan Tokhang,\" its house-to-house knock and plead operations against drug suspects. It said it would shift to cleansing its ranks and addressing other crimes.  The government has many times defended Duterte’s war on drugs, where some 3,800 have died in legitimate police operations, according to police statistics. Officials said slain drug suspects had put up violent resistance. The administration has also repeatedly asserted that it does not sanction summary killings nor condone police abuses. Human rights groups, however, estimate the death toll at 13,000, a figure dismissed by the government as overblown. In January, the President had also ordered the PNP to step back and allow the PDEA to take the lead in the war on drugs following the death of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo allegedly in the hands of police officials. Jee was killed right inside the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame.  A month later, he ordered the force to go back to conducting anti-illegal drug operations, citing the resurgence of the drug trade on the streets. The police has credited the anti-drug campaign in bringing the crime rate down.",

Duterte on Thursday signed Proclamation No. 360 formally terminating peace talks with the National Democratic Front (NDF) of the Philippines, following continued attacks by the New People’s Army (NDF) on state troops.  The President hinted one of the reasons that prompted him to terminate the talks is the supposed inclination of the communist rebels to become part of a coalition government. “As it was shaping up during our talks, I already noticed the trend of the thoughts of the other side and when I summed it all, reading from all previous working papers, it would sound like a coalition government,” Duterte said in a speech in Camp Tecson in San Miguel, Bulacan. “That is why I said in the previous days, I cannot give you what I don’t own and certainly a coalition with the Republic of the Philippines is pure nonsense.” Duterte, a former student of Communist Party of the Philippines founding chairman Jose Maria Sison, had sought to end the nearly 50-year communist insurgency early in his term, even appointing leftists to his Cabinet as a demonstration of the two sides' warming ties. “I said, well let it not be said I did not try to reach out to them, for after all, during the campaign, my promise to the people of the Philippines was that I would suppress corruption in government and I’m hell bent on doing it,” he said.

The talks were stalled following armed clashes between government troops and communist guerrillas.  Duterte's anger against the communists was reignited following the death of a 4-month-old girl who was hit by stray bullet in a rebel ambush in Bukidnon earlier this month. In terminating the peace talks, Duterte also threatened to declare the communist rebels as terrorists.  He also threatened to order the arrest of members of communist “legal fronts\" which are pursuing parliamentary struggles. The President also again ordered the arrest of communist leaders who were released from detention for the peace talks. “I will go after you and I don’t really care whatever happens thereafter,” he said.",

            "content": "MANILA- The Department of Justice (DOJ) defended on Friday its resolution dismissing the criminal complaint against several former customs officials in connection with the P6.4-billion “shabu” shipment that slipped past the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in May. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said he was willing to face any probe into the matter, even as he said critics “should read the complaint and the subject resolution… before any person makes any comment.” “We are ready and willing to face anybody to justify the DOJ Resolution,” Aguirre said.  He stressed that the complainants could still file a motion for reconsideration “where they could cure some defects in their complaint and/or give additional evidence to strengthen their case against those persons not indicted.” Assistant State Prosecutor Aristotle Reyes, chair of the DOJ investigating panel, and panel member Associate Prosecution Attorney II Joan Garcia, explained that complainant Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) did not make the necessary allegations against respondent former BOC Commissioner Nicanor Faeldon, former BOC Directors Milo Maestrecampo and Neil Anthony Estrella; intelligence officers Joel Pinawin and Oliver Valiente; Manila International Container Port District collector lawyer Vincent Phillip Maronilla; Customs employees Alexandra Ventura, Randolph Cabansag, Dennis Maniego, Dennis Cabildo and John Edillor; and, Atty. Jeline Maree Magsuci. The panel also said there was no evidence presented against these respondents. In the 95-page resolution of the case, the panel said “ t]here was, in fact, no mention of any specific acts or omissions by which the\nabove-named respondents have committed the imputed violations of law.” “Thus, PDEA’s complaint failed to comply with the burden of proof required under the circumstances. In this jurisdiction, it is a settled rule that when the evidence is consistent with a finding of innocence and also compatible with a finding of guilt, then the evidence is at equipoise and does not fulfill the test of moral certainty to support a conviction. “Consequently, the decision should be against the party with the burden of proof,” the resolution read. The charges against several respondent National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) officials, who joined the BOC in its raid after the subject “shabu,” were also dropped by the DOJ.  However, probable cause was found to indict fixer Mark Taguba; businessman Kenneth Dong; Hongfei Logistics Group of Companies chairman Chen Ju Long (alias Richard Tan or Richard Chen); businessman Li Guang Feng alias Manny Li; Eirene May Tatad, owner of EMT Trading; Taiwanese nationals Chen I-Min and Jhu Ming Jyun, Hongfei's Chen Rong Huan; and, three unidentified individuals.  The justice chief's comments followed criticisms from several senators. The DOJ on Wednesday dismissed the complaint filed by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency against several customs officials due to the agency's failure to state the involvement of Faeldon and other officials in the smuggling incident.",

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. said Duterte made the promise during his meeting with the families of the massacre victims on Thursday, November 23, when the nation commemorated the 8th year anniversary of the killings, considered the worst election-related violence in Philippine history. \"The families went to see the President to personally seek his help in their long quest for justice against the powerful members of the Ampatuan clan in Maguindanao,” Roque said in a statement, adding the President in turn “assured them that justice will be delivered under his watch.” Roque said Duterte ordered Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, and state prosecutors present in the meeting “to see to it that a conviction would be handed down to the principal accused the soonest time possible.” “President Duterte, a former prosecutor himself, even shared his thoughts on the dynamics and intricacies of the justice system, noting that even the right of the accused to be heard is sacred under our democratic rules,” Roque said. “Nevertheless, he expressed optimism that the strength of the case against them— 188 respondents in all— will eventually lead to a verdict favorable to the victims.” Duterte also ordered that the families be given employment, scholarships, and financial assistance. As the nation marked the 8th year since the massacre, which claimed the lives of 58 people, including 32 members of the media, justice remains elusive for the families of the victims. According to the fact sheet provided by the PTFoMS, of the 188 suspects officially charged for the killings, 106 are currently under detention while 82 remain at large. Not a single conviction, however, has been achieved.",

Cayetano said Abella will be an \"asset\" to the DFA, and he expects that the latter will be able to help effectively deliver messages by the Philippines internationally. The Philippines, under Duterte, has pursued what he calls an independent foreign policy, wherein the government has sought to lessen Manila’s dependence on Washington while fostering closer ties with other powers such as China and Russia. Abella, a pastor who served as Duterte’s spokesperson for over a year, has been known for his calm demeanor and was instrumental in softening the impact of some of the President's controversial statements.

Aquino III and several other past and incumbent public officials for possible malversation of public funds in connection with the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP). Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II issued Department Order No. 749 for the purpose.  The justice chief also issued Department Order No. 751 directing the NBI to create a special task force which will be under the direct supervision of Justice Undersecretary Antonio Kho, Jr. READ: DOJ orders NBI to probe malversation complaint vs ex-Pres. Noynoy Aquino, et al. pic.twitter.com/sbsKn8Nwkp  Former Manila City Councilor Greco Belgica and the Coalition for\nInvestigation and Prosecution sought the probe, after they reportedly had a hard time securing the necessary documents pertaining to the DAP and 116 projects under the disbursement program. Apart from Aquino, Belgica’s group sought an investigation against\nformer Budget Secretary Butch Abad, former Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Aguinaldo, former Transportation and Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas, Senator Franklin Drilon, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, former Budget Undersecretary Mario Relampagos, and Atty. Yolanda D. Doblon (Director General, Senate Legislative Budget Research and Monitoring Office). The DAP, instituted during the previous Aquino administration, was raised before the Supreme Court, with the high court striking down several acts and practices under the program as unconstitutional namely,  a) the withdrawal of unobligated allotment from the implementing agencies and the declaration of the withdrawn unobligated allotments and unreleased appropriations as savings prior to the end of the fiscal year and without complying with the statutory definition of savings contained in the General Appropriation Acts (GAAs);  b) the cross-border transfers of the savings of the Executive to augment the appropriations of other offices outside the Executive; and,  c) funding of projects and activities and programs that were not covered by any appropriation in the GAA. The Supreme Court also declared void the use of unprogrammed funds under the DAP despite the absence of a certification from the National Treasurer that the revenue collections exceeded the revenue targets. Belgica was one of the petitioners in this case before the high court. In a statement, Belgica hoped all those responsible for alleged anomalies under the program be held accountable “regardless of political affiliation.” “We only pray for truth and justice to be served. DAP is a crime that has been declared almost 4 years ago. Its investigation and the prosecution of its perpetrators have been since then by those who committed it and with many of those who still remain in power. “DOJ and NBI can now use our template to build up cases against all culprits regardless of political affiliation and verify what we\nsubmitted. All our evidence have been submitted to DOJ… Parusahan ang dapat parusahan,” Belgica said. The DAP was also said to have been used by the previous administration to “bribe” senators into ousting former Chief Justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial, but officials of the Aquino administration said the program was only intended to spur government spending and economic growth.  The Ombudsman early this year cleared Aquino from charges over the alleged illegal implementation of the P72-billion DAP. Former Budget Secretary Florencio Abad was the only official found liable for its supposed illegal implementation.  ",

Gandamra said the estimated value needed to rebuild a “better” Marawi was based on the government’s \"consolidated master plan\" completed several weeks ago. \"Kung meron po akong authority na magbigay, ay initially meron ho tayong an amount of P90 billion,” Gandamra said in a news conference in Malacañang. \"Kung aayusin po natin ang Marawi City ay hindi po natin --- hindi lang ho ibabalik natin sa dati. But of course, we will make it better than it was before. 'Yun po ang ating gusto. And of course, no amount of money that can compensate doon ho sa nangyari sa Marawi City.\" According to Gandamra, the amount will not only be used to rehabilitate structures and restore economic operations in the city, but also to launch “peace-building” efforts to ensure the city will not suffer from another attack from Islamist extremists. Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) chairperson Eduardo del Rosario, head of Task Force Bangon Marawi, earlier said the government continues to conduct post-conflict needs assessment in the city, which shall determine the actual amount needed to rehabilitate Marawi. He said an initial estimate would be announced in January 2018 while the final amount would be made public in March 2018. The Marawi siege ended last October 23 following 5 months of fierce battles between the Maute terrorist groups and state forces. It left some 1,100 dead, mostly terrorists, and displaced over 350,000 residents from the city and nearby towns. The military’s relentless bombings on the terrorists’ lairs in the main battle area, coupled with blasts from improvised explosive devices planted by the terrorists, have left the city’s commercial district in ruins.",

By midday, 23 people had been killed. \tThe locally-run Ghouta Media Center said 22 civilians had been killed. \tRescuers arriving at the scene in Misraba, a town in the eastern Ghouta region, picked up the wounded and the dead from where they'd fallen, in streets in a residential area in the town, as seen in a video posted by the Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group, also known as the White Helmets. \tRebels in Eastern Ghouta have held out against government forces throughout the nearly seven years of the country's civil war. \tConditions are dire inside the region, which is suffering from shortages of food and medicine due to a government-enforced blockade.

Close to 1 million people in Yemen, including many children, suffer from cholera or acute watery diarrhea. \t\"The war in Yemen is sadly a war on children,\" he said. \"Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian crisis I have ever seen in my life.\" \tYemenis have endured an intensified 2-1/2-year war. \tIt involves Iranian-backed Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, who control many population centers in western Yemen, and an internationally recognized government that has the backing of Saudi Arabia and several other key Persian Gulf states. \tThe Saudi-led coalition tightened its Yemen blockade on Nov. 6, in response to rebel missile fire toward the Saudi capital. \tSince then, the coalition has come under growing international pressure to ease the restrictions. \tLast week, it said it would reopen Sanaa airport and the port of Hodeida to humanitarian aid shipments by the end of that week. \tUN flights to Sanaa resumed Saturday, including the shipment of vaccines. \tCappelaere said the 1.9 million doses are meant to vaccinate 600,000 children across Yemen against diphtheria, meningitis, whopping cough, pneumonia and tuberculosis. \tClose to 180 cases of diphtheria have been reported in the past two months, starting from the governorate of Ibb, but spreading to four other districts. \tThe delivery of vaccines Saturday \"cannot be a one-off,\" he said, adding that many more supplies, including vaccines, are needed. \tLike other aid officials in recent months, he appealed for a swift end to the war. \"The absence of a political solution to the Yemeni crisis is deplorable,\" he said. \tYemen, the Arab world's poorest nation, has been caught up in the rivalry between regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Iran that has also helped fuel conflicts elsewhere, including in Syria.",

            "content": "BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel faced pressure from inside her conservative bloc yesterday to aim for a quick coalition deal with center-left rivals without conceding too much ground on core issues such as immigration. \tTalks between Merkel's conservative bloc and two smaller parties to form a previously untried coalition collapsed a week ago. Merkel's partners in the outgoing government, the center-left Social Democrats, initially refused to consider a repeat but said Friday they're open to holding talks. \tIf Merkel can't put together a coalition, the only options would be a minority government or a new election, months after the Sept. 24 vote. \tOn yesterday, the youth wing of Merkel's Union bloc published a resolution stating that the conservatives must not enter a coalition \"at any price.\" Its leader, Paul Ziemiak, said any deal must contain recognizable conservative policies, particularly on migration and public finances. \tMerkel's conservatives have pushed to curb migrant flows and are keen to ensure that Germany sticks to a balanced budget. \tNegotiations \"should be viewed as failed\" if there is no deal by Christmas and the conservatives should instead aim for an unprecedented minority government, the resolution said. \tIt remains to be seen what party leaders will make of the proposed timetable, which looks unrealistic. Meanwhile, Merkel's outgoing Cabinet remains in office on a caretaker basis. \tThe Social Democrats, smarting from a disastrous result in September, have made clear they would demand a high price for cooperating again with Merkel's Union bloc. \t\"As things stand, Merkel is not in a position in which she can set conditions,\" prominent Social Democrat Malu Dreyer told the daily Trierscher Volksfreund on Saturday. \tMerkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper that her caretaker government won't take decisions that could bind its successor's hands on \"major political questions.\" That includes French President Emmanuel Macron's proposals for reforming the European Union. \tAltmaier said the \"constructive restraint\" applies to \"all European questions\" as well as domestic matters, but said Berlin's position on Brexit won't be affected.",

            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 3:17am",
            "content": "ZAGREB — Ivica Todoric will no longer be living in his sprawling 16th-century castle overlooking Croatia's capital, flying in his private helicopter to his luxurious coastal villa or taking his yacht for a trip in the Adriatic. \tCroatia's most wanted fugitive, known locally as \"the Boss,\" surrendered to London police this month amid accusations that he mismanaged his food and retail multinational and embezzled millions, leading it into a bankruptcy so massive that it's now an issue of national concern for several southeastern European countries. \tTodoric's company, Agrokor is collapsing under the weight of $7 billion in debt, a sum so large that bailing it out fully would bankrupt the Croatian state itself. But letting the company go under would threaten 60,000 employees and thousands more jobs through a supply chain that includes farmers across the region. Meanwhile, the main creditors — Russian banks — are on the war path to extract whatever value they can. \t\"Croatia faces an economic and financial tsunami that is beyond imagination,\" Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said during a recent parliamentary debate over the government's handling of the crisis and calls for his resignation. \tThe story of Todoric, 66, and Agrokor, which accounts for 15 percent of Croatia's GDP, has exposed crony capitalism, shady privatization in the former communist country, and close connections between politics and business in the Balkans, which is still recovering from the bloody breakup of the former Yugoslav federation in the 1990s. \t___ \tIT STARTS WITH FLOWERS \tTogether with his father Ante, Todoric constructed a greenhouse in 1976 selling flowers throughout former Yugoslavia when the country's communist regime started introducing market reforms. The business went well, prompting the family to establish Agrokor as a joint stock company in 1989. \tLike many Croatian businessmen with good political connections, Todoric took advantage of the war years in the 1990s to take part in the large-scale privatization process of the state-run companies, which were sold for cheap through shady and irregular deals. \tWith good connections to the ruling elite, Todoric in 1993 bought several companies, including supermarkets belonging to the biggest retailer in the capital. \t\"The privatization that was undertaken in the 90's caused so many problems in Croatia,\" said Orsat Miljenic, the head of a parliamentary commission set to deal with political aspects of the crisis. \"So many good factories just disappeared. So many people who didn't have any money now are very rich.\" \tAgrokor \"became a bigger power than the state itself,\" Miljenic said. \tRunning the company with his two sons and daughter, Todoric kept expanding aggressively, buying everything from agricultural land to water bottling firms, meat-processing farms to ice cream-making companies and newspaper stands. \tAgrokor also expanded outside Croatia, with assets in neighboring Serbia, Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics. \t___ \tTHE CRASH \tAnalysts say Todoric's zeal for expansion triggered Agrokor's financial collapse. \tIn 2014, Todoric bought 53 percent of struggling Slovenian retailer Mercator for 550 million euros, using loans from Russian state-owned bank Sberbank that carried a high interest rate. Analysts say the purchase of Mercator was the death blow for Agrokor's finances as it made the debt unsustainable. \tCroatia's entry into the European Union in 2013 also hurt the company, as its supermarkets suddenly faced tough competition from large German and other foreign retail chains that were allowed to open in the country. \tAgrokor's financial collapse is a \"combination of fast expansion, overinvestment, low profitability and high-cost borrowing, which resulted in not enough cash flow to service its credit obligations,\" financial consultant Andrej Grubisic said. \t___ \tRUSSIAN CONNECTION AND POLITICS \tRussian money played a big role in Agrokor's financing, prompting fears in Croatia that the Kremlin has been strategically trying to increase its political influence in the EU's newest member. \tSberbank is Agrokor's biggest creditor with 1.1 billion euros. Another Russian bank close to the Kremlin, VTB, contributed with rollover loans worth about 300 million euros. The other main creditors include Austria's Erste Group and Raiffeisenbank and Italy's UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. \t\"Whenever there is big money, there's some politics behind it,\" said Miljenic, who was formerly Croatia's justice minister and is now in the opposition. \"If the banks are owned by a state, logically, there should be even more politics.\" \tThe government caretaker of Agrokor has recognized creditor claims worth some $6.3 billion, but Sberbank's loan was not included, officially because the bank has launched legal claims against Agrokor companies in other countries, including Britain. \tThat has triggered angry reaction from Sberbank, which said in a statement it was \"unpleasantly surprised\" with the Croatian government's stance. \t\"Everyone, including Sberbank, can resort to any legally allowed measure, in Croatia or in other countries, to protect its interests and must not be discriminated against because of that,\" the statement said, adding that the bank will appeal the decision. \t___ \tTODORIC REMAINS DEFIANT \tTodoric formally still owns Agrokor but the Croatian government has taken over its management and gave itself until next summer to rescue what it can of the company. \tTodoric fled to London amid the charges of embezzlement, which Croatian authorities used to start seizing his private property to help pay off Agrokor's debts. \tAfter he appeared on European police's fugitive arrest list, Todoric wrote on his blog that his conscience was clear. \t\"As a man whose human rights are deeply violated I have the right to oppose political persecution,\" Todoric wrote. \tTodoric has been claiming that the government illegally took over his company and indicated that he will fight his extradition from Britain on the grounds that he is the victim of political pursuit. He has announced he would file a law suit against the so-called \"Lex-Agrokor\" — a law passed by the parliament that allowed the takeover.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang backpedaled yesterday on its pronouncement that President Duterte would bring the police back to the government’s war on illegal drugs because he was not satisfied with the accomplishments of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Duterte is still considering whether to give back to the police the lead role in the crackdown on illegal drugs even as he repeatedly raised doubts on the PDEA’s capability to enforce the campaign, according to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque.  “I have to ask guidance from the President. It has been reported that the police would be involved again in the war on drugs. But when I was with him the other night, when we were with the victims of Maguindanao massacre on the 23rd of November, he said he was still thinking about it,” Roque told radio station dzBB yesterday.  Roque said he would clarify the matter with Duterte during the President’s visit to Sultan Kudarat today. He believes the criticisms against the return of the Philippine National Police (PNP) to the campaign against illegal drugs are still premature.  “It is important once and for all to ask him. I myself seemed to have changed my declaration because when I saw him (Duterte) on television, and if you heard what he said, it seemed that he already had a decision. But when I was with him, he was still thinking about it, Roque said.  Duterte removed the PNP from the anti-drug campaign after the death of two teenage suspects sparked outrage last August.  Kian delos Santos, a 17-year-old student accused of being a drug runner, and 19-year-old Carl Arnaiz, a suspected robber were believed to have been executed by the Caloocan City police. The incidents prompted the President to issue last October a memorandum stating that the PDEA would be the sole agency to conduct drug-related operations. A few days after issuing the memorandum, Duterte expressed doubts that the PDEA would be able to perform the task because of lack of manpower.  Last week, Duterte said he was inclined to bring back the police to the campaign to prevent the drug problem from becoming worse.  But Roque, a human rights lawyer, reiterated that Duterte does not condone any form of abuse. “Believe it or not, the President and I do not differ when it comes to the issue of human rights. The President would back the police if it is doing the right thing… If a policeman kills without a reason, he would order the arrest of that policeman,” Roque said.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Sweden has raised with the Philippine government the issues on human rights, the conduct of the war on drugs and the possible reintroduction of capital punishment. Oscar Stenstrom, deputy minister of trade and European Union affairs, raised the issues during a meeting with officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) during his two-day visit in Manila on Wednesday and Thursday last week to improve bilateral trade. During the meetings, Stenstrom also raised developments that concern the Swedish government and Swedish businesses in the country.  “I have raised the issues of human rights, about the possible reintroduction of capital punishment. The questions on human rights and especially how law enforcement has been conducting the war on drugs concern us. It’s an issue which I brought up with the government of the Philippines,” Stenstrom said in an interview with The STAR on Thursday after a meeting with Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Enrique Manalo at the DFA in Pasay City. Stenstrom said Swedish companies operating in the Philippines are concerned about the developments. “If they are concerned, we are concerned, and as I said we have a very strong view on human rights, which I have explained to the Philippine government that we disagree here. We would like to see improvement and we are expecting improvement,” he stressed. The developments that concern Sweden were also discussed during a meeting with Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez. “I can only say that we have different views on the issue. It’s very clear, the position of the Swedish government as well as the EU Commission,” Stenstrom said. “But I also received an answer that they moved the responsibility from the national police to the PDEA and with the promise that that would improve the situation and this is now to be seen by us,” he added, referring to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. But President Duterte said he needed to give back to the Philippine National Police (PNP) the lead role in the war on narcotics because the drug menace continued to worsen. The document ordering the return of the drug war operation to the PNP is reportedly awaiting Duterte’s signature. Last month, Duterte designated the PDEA as the agency in charge of the war on drugs. The order returning the PNP to the frontline of the war on drugs was not mentioned by Philippine officials during the meeting. “That was not mentioned to me,” Stenstrom said.  Sweden, he said, would like to see the Philippines keep the GSP+ trade privilege, which the EU had threatened to cancel because of the alleged extrajudicial killings related to the drug war. In March, the EU was urged to follow a proposal hitting the Philippine government where it may hurt most,  by removing trade incentives for the country. Members of the European Parliament asked the EU to put pressure on the Philippines by considering the removal of the GSP+ privilege. “In the future, we would like to see a free trade arrangement between the EU and the Philippines. We also would like to see the Philippines keep the GSP+, the arrangement in which the trade is ongoing right now,” Stenstrom said.",

            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The House of Representatives’ recent plenary approval of a measure seeking to cut significantly the bureaucratic red tape in acquiring government clearances and permits will help attract more foreign direct investments in the country.  Iloilo Rep. Ferjenel Biron, chairman of the House committee on trade and industry, said House Bill 6579  or “An Act Establishing a National Policy on Ease of Doing Business” will create a business environment conducive to investors. The bill seeks to lessen the rather complex and often circuitous documentation procedures – both in the national government and local government units – and waiting time in business permit application.  He said the measure will provide a mechanism that will fast-track approval of business permits and licenses and harmonize regulations of national government agencies with local government. Biron is main author of the bill, which is co-authored by Reps. Vilma Santos-Recto of Batangas, Winston Castelo of Quezon City, LRay Villafuerte of Camarines Sur and Gus Tambunting of Parañaque, among others. The bill prescribes a maximum processing time of one working day at the barangay level, three working days for simple applications, and 10 working days – from time of receipt – for complex applications. Meanwhile, a congressional technical working group has drafted an enhanced public-private partnership (PPP) bill to hasten the implementation of big-ticket projects under President Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” campaign. House Bill 788 or the PPP Rationalization Act aims to provide clear parameters on project procedures, completion timetable and amount of projects to be approved by the government. “The measure is what the government needs as a pillar of infrastructure development, especially with the entry of more players encouraged by the President’s ‘Build, Build, Build’ campaign,” said Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, author of the bill. The reforms introduced by HB 788 provide for simpler rules for faster decision-making and reduce current project timetable from 30 months to 18 or 24 months. It also enhances competition with its new framework on unsolicited projects that would allow their inclusion in the priority list or convert these into solicited projects. “The recent impressive unsolicited offers from giant conglomerates to fund and undertake big-ticket infrastructure projects to spur the country’s economic growth will most likely speed up the passage of HB 788,” Salceda said. He said the Filinvest-RLC-JG Summit Holdings consortium has offered to build the P839-billion Clark International Airport while San Miguel Corp.-RSA has proposed to build the P700-billion Bulacan Airport under the PPP scheme. He said the PPP bill aims to accelerate the implementation of the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 under which giant transport and industrial projects are listed. The enactment of the PPP Rationalization Act is seen to help fund up to P6.3 trillion worth of projects under the Duterte administration. Salceda said the country would require “an intensified infrastructure spending and better selected infrastructure investments to support higher economic growth and improve quality of life in both urban and rural communities.” The measure also seeks the creation of a “Risk Management Fund” to ensure fiscal sustainability and enhance the  ability of implementing agencies in the discharge of their contractual obligations.",

            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — At age 33 and raising six children in a slum named “Paradise Village,” Myrna Albos is Exhibit A for the country’s serial family planning failures. The plumber’s wife already had four children by the time a family planning law was passed in December 2012, but she had two more after opponents blocked it and the government health center near her shanty ran out of birth control pills. “I don’t want any more (children). Sending all of them to school is an effort. One more and I may no longer have time for myself,” the former department store clerk told AFP. Albos and her family live on her husband’s $10-a-day wage in a dirt-floor home in Paradise Village, tucked behind a smelly open sewer in the north of Manila, the nation’s capital where millions live in brutal poverty. condoms, birth control pills, implants and other family planning methods to couples in poor communities, while protecting mothers from death and other health risks associated with pregnancies. The law was hailed then as a big victory for the rights of the poor, finally overcoming the powerful Catholic Church and their socially conservative allies in Congress. The Philippines, a former Spanish colony, is the Church’s Asian bastion with 80 percent of the nation’s 103 million people Catholic. The power of the Church has helped to ensure abortion and divorce remain illegal. The country’s fertility rate slowed to 2.33 births per woman in 2015 from a runaway six in the 1970s, United Nations data shows but it remains an outlier. The number of Filipinas who die from complications of giving birth also remains high, according to the UN figures. However, the legislation turned out to be only the start of another long battle. The law itself did not come into force until April 2014, as it was delayed by legal challenges. While the Supreme Court ruled the legislation was constitutional, it defanged the law by removing penalties for officials and workers who refused to provide contraceptives. It has since been weakened further after some conservative legislators gutted its funding. “We have not taken off. We’ve been taxiing for the last five years,” Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo told AFP in an interview, when asked to assess the program. He said the Supreme Court’s removal of the penalty provisions had rendered the law “basically toothless,” while a lack of funds meant the government could not buy enough contraceptives. President Duterte, who took office last year, has followed in his predecessor’s  footsteps in trying to get contraceptives to the masses. His Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this month ruled that dozens of contraceptives, including implants and pills, were not abortion inducing and thus the government could distribute them for free. Condoms were not subject to the challenge but only two percent of Filipino men use them, according to the health department. This is partly due to men not wanting to use them, and their expense. Church-backed groups filed a case with the Supreme Court in 2015 insisting the implants and other contraceptives were abortifacients, and thus unconstitutional. The Supreme Court then ordered the government not to distribute those contraceptives until the FDA made its own ruling on the issue. Bayugo said the government had started to deliver 500,000 implants, the vast majority of its stocks, following this month’s FDA ruling. But he said it was not nearly enough to tackle the problem. “The resolution will not cure the funding issue... it’s been our problem for the last five years,” he told AFP. The health department estimates six million couples need contraceptives, but have no reliable access to them. This year’s allocated budget of P165 million ($3.2 million) is only enough for two million of these couples, according to Bayugo. Congress rejected the original family planning budget proposal for 2017 of P1.2 billion. The health department has sought a budget of P342 million for next year. But this is still less than a third of what the government deemed necessary to fully implement the law. With less than six weeks left in 2017, Congress has yet to approve next year’s family planning budget. While the government was banned from dispensing implants, lbos the slum mother, went to Likhaan, a charity that receives foreign funding. She finally had an implant, which releases a hormone that prevents women’s ovaries from releasing eggs, after her sixth child was born this year. Non-government groups including Likhaan have been providing birth control services to about 150,000 people falling outside the health department coverage, its executive director, Junice Melgar, told AFP. But even their own modest programs have suffered setbacks that highlight the enduring political problems. Last year, scores of panicked women swamped Manila clinics demanding the removal of their hormone implants, Melgar said. The incidents were confirmed by Bayugo. The women were scared off by a politician’s unfounded warnings the implants caused cancer, polio and even blindness, they said.",

            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The government yesterday burned P142.44 million worth of cigarettes bearing fake tax stamps in Davao City, the Department of Finance (DOF) said over the weekend. The cigarettes, totaling 9,496 master cases (4.75 million packs), were seized from Mighty Corp.’s warehouse in General Santos City last March 6 during a joint operation by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) and Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). “The decision to destroy these cigarettes came easily. We imposed sin taxes on these in part to protect the health of our people. It would be wrong to release these products to the market,” said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III in a speech read by assistant secretary Kelvin Lee. The finance chief said the destruction of the goods “is intended to deliver this message: tax evasion does not pay.” “We will confiscate (these) products and destroy them. No one will profit from the commission of a crime,” he said. According to the DOF, the destruction of the millions of cigarette packs will be done in batches due to their huge quantity. About eight tons of cigarettes  per day will be burned through Holcim Philippines Geocycle’s co-processing method. Holcim Philippines said the method ensures the total thermal destruction of waste materials, and reduces toxic gas emissions, land and groundwater pollution in the process. In line with the Duterte administration’s intensified drive against smuggling and tax evasion, the BIR and BOC have stepped up their joint operations to search and seize illicit products. Earlier this year, the two agencies conducted a series of operations against Mighty Corp., which allegedly affixed counterfeit tax stamps to their products. Aside from this batch, the government is also set to destroy another 66,245 cases of Mighty cigarettes confiscated in San Simon, Pampanga; 163,183 cases in San Ildefonso, Bulacan; and other smaller stockpiles in Tacloban and Cebu. All of these, including those in General Santos, constituted the evidence of three tax evasion cases filed by the government against the cigarette manufacturer. However, the cases were withdrawn after the company offered to settle its tax liabilities in the amount of P25 billion. Mighty Corp. subsequently sold its assets to Japan Tobacco International Philippines Inc. to help pay off its tax arrears. Dominguez said this resulted in the largest amount of tax settlement ever paid by a single corporate entity in the country’s history, which included the P5 billion value-added tax generated by the BIR from the acquisition deal.",

            "title": "Sereno contract for IT consultant anomalous — report",
            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The contract approved by Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, hiring an information technology (IT) consultant for her office was anomalous, according to a report in the Supreme Court (SC). The report submitted recently to the SC recommended that the contract amounting to about P10 million for the services of IT consultant Helen Perez-Macasaet be voided for “lapses in the procurement process.” It stated that the contract violated existing laws and Commission on Audit rules because it did not undergo public bidding. The report was submitted by newly appointed Assistant Court Administrator Maria Regina Adoracion Filomena Ignacio, acting chief attorney of the SC, who was tasked to investigate the matter in an earlier administrative order. The contract, which covered six periods of six months each from October 2013 to June 2016, involved the services of Macasaet “to provide technical and policy advice to the Office of the Chief Justice and the Management Information Systems Office of the SC regarding implementation of its Enterprise Information Systems Plan and related information communication technology projects.” In the first period under the contract, Macasaet was paid P600,000 or P100,000 per month. But in the succeeding periods, the amount was increased to P1.5 million or P250,000 per month. An insider told The STAR that the report has been submitted to the justices but they have yet to review it and decide whether or not to approve the recommendation of Ignacio and strike down the contract, which had been fully paid and already lapsed. This issue of Sereno’s IT consultant is among the 27 allegations in the impeachment complaint of lawyer Lorenzo Gadon against the Chief Justice before the House justice committee. “Then chief attorney of the SC, now assistant ombudsman, lawyer Edna Diño, raised the matter about the hiring by respondent Sereno of an ICT consultant, since it would put on hold the consultancy services already bid out but not yet awarded,” Gadon alleged in his complaint. Gadon claimed that the Chief Justice committed betrayal of public trust for her “willful failure to procure the services of an ICT consultant in accordance with law and public policy.” Sereno answered by claiming that it was the SC that hired Macasaet, who was chosen from among three choices through a “negotiated procurement.” The Chief Justice also argued that Macasaet’s services are “highly technical in nature” so the contract is exempted from the public bidding requirement. The source, however, explained that the SC might not be able to provide the House a certified copy of the report because it is “a pending administrative case which is covered by the court’s confidentiality rule.” The House justice committee could summon the official who prepared the report, suggested the insider, a member of the SC who requested anonymity due to lack of authority to speak for the court. The justice committee is set to continue this week its hearings to determine the existence of probable cause in the impeachment charges against Sereno. It has invited several witnesses, including Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro, who has agreed to appear. De Castro was invited by the House for the internal memorandum she filed in the SC last July questioning several administrative orders of Sereno, including the appointment of a Philippine Judicial Academy (Philja) official and the provision of travel allowances for her staff. As exclusively reported by The STAR earlier, De Castro specifically assailed the appointment of lawyer Brenda Jay Mendoza as Philja chief of office for the Philippine Mediation Center, which she said violated Administrative Order No. 33-2008 that required the appointment to be approved by the SC collegially. De Castro also assailed Sereno’s grant of foreign travel allowance to members of her staff without the required approval from the SC. She said the Chief Justice’s staff members were given travel allowances even when their trips abroad were on “official time,” which should not involve expenditure of public funds. De Castro also questioned the “long delay” in the appointment of personnel to key positions in the SC, “which is prejudicial to the best interest of the service.” The issues in De Castro’s memorandum are among the grounds for impeachment raised by Gadon in his complaint.",

            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines — The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will convert the 10,000-bed mega drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Fort Magsaysay, Nueva Ecija into a barracks and training facility if President Duterte formally turns it over to the military. Duterte earlier said he is giving the center to the military because only a few hundred drug dependents have actually enrolled to use it to kick the habit. “If that is what the President wants, the AFP could make good use of the facility for barracks, training and other activities of the military in the area,” AFP spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla told The STAR. The Fort Magsaysay Military Reservation, where the mega center is located, is considered to be the largest military reservation in the Philippines and a key training facility of the Philippine Army. It is also designated as the AFP National Training Center for upgrading and training battalion sized units, producing more than 72 Army and 12 Marine battalions in just six years. The Department of Health was supposed to run the facility. Its data showed that only 663 drug dependents have so far been admitted at the center, a majority of them from the National Capital Region, Region 3 and Region 4-B. It also showed that most were unemployed while others were tricycle drivers and construction workers. At least one was identified as a barangay captain. Health Undersecretary Roger Tong-an said 60 drug dependents, which comprised the third batch of patients who underwent treatment at the mega center, are set to graduate on Nov. 29, in time for the facility’s first founding anniversary. Tong-an said the dependents stayed there from four to six months to undergo rehabilitation. Former Dangerous Drugs Board chair Dionisio Santiago earlier said building the mega rehab was a mistake, pointing out that a smaller community-based rehabilitation center would have done the job.",

            "timestamp": "November 27, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno’s colleagues in the Supreme Court will have the final say on whether or not SC Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro can face the House committee on justice that is hearing Sereno’s impeachment case. Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali, panel chairman, said the invitation they extended to De Castro and other SC personnel, including the clerks of court of the three divisions in the 15-member tribunal, will have to be cleared first by the justices. “Justice De Castro will not appear yet because the justices and court personnel need the imprimatur of the SC en banc,” the senior administration lawmaker said, as the justice committee resumes its hearing today until Wednesday to determine probable cause. Sereno and De Castro are known to be adversaries. It is reportedly an open secret in the judiciary that the Chief Justice is not popular among her peers and even court employees, unlike her predecessors who received full support during their own impeachment battles. The other chief justices who were impeached the late chief justice Renato Corona, who was eventually convicted by the Senate impeachment court in May 2012; and retired chief justice Hilario Davide who survived ouster attempts. Other SC officials invited by the House committee on justice are Court Administrator Midas Marquez, SC clerk of court Felipa Anama and several others, including The Manila Times senior reporter Jomar Canlas, to shed light in the impeachment complaint against Sereno. Should those invited fail to appear because of the absence of the SC imprimatur, Umali said the House committee on justice would deliberate on the remaining allegations in the first two grounds of the impeachment complaint. Witnesses can testify either tomorrow or Wednesday, he added. Umali said they would not hesitate to order the arrest of Sereno in case she ignores a subpoena compelling her presence, citing its “coercive power” in an interview with Rowena Salvacion’s Buena Manong Balita radio program over dzBB yesterday. “(We have) coercive power under the Constitution. This is a constitutional power to pursue a constitutional mandate. The separation of powers as co-equal branch may not be invoked in this particular instance,” he said. He said his committee does not need the signature of Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez in the issuance of arrest warrants because they are performing a constitutional mandate of hearing a verified impeachment complaint. Umali added that the justice committee needs to finish the impeachment process within 60 session days. The camp of the Chief Justice is unfazed by testimonies of witnesses against her in the House. Her lawyers belittled even the testimony of De Castro, who reportedly agreed to appear in the House justice committee hearings this week, believing it would not debunk the “strong defense” that they presented. “Whether it would affect our defense or not, we are not worried at all. We don’t see any reason to be worried about it,” said lawyer Winnie Salumbides, one of Sereno’s spokespersons, in a statement yesterday. But while they claim not to be alarmed by De Castro’s testimony, Sereno’s camp still slammed the plan as “highly irregular.” “As a lawyer, I find it highly irregular for a magistrate, for a Supreme Court justice to go down and take the witness stand. I think it’s unconventional for a magistrate to become a witness,” Salumbides said. The lawyer also warned of violation of the confidentiality rule in the SC by De Castro after she was named as a source of information and documents by lawyer Lorenzo Gadon, complainant in the impeachment case against the Chief Justice, during the hearing last week. They cited a possible violation of the Internal Rules of the SC, which safeguard the confidentiality of sessions and internal documents of the tribunal. Salumbides said SC sessions are executive in character, with only its members present and that deliberations are confidential and should not be disclosed to outside parties, except if authorized by the court. He added that SC rollos may only be released upon an official written request from the judicial staff head or the chief of office of the requesting office and that all persons handling these documents are bound by the same strict confidentiality rules. The SC has approved earlier the release of certified copies of records and documents for the impeachment case against Sereno as sought by Gadon and the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption, whose separate impeachment complaint was dismissed by the House panel. The documents include the Chief Justice’s statements of assets, liabilities, and net worth; records of her foreign and domestic travels; and documents about her custom-made bulletproof vehicle. The records also include the SC’s administrative ruling that voided Sereno’s decision to create a regional court administration office in Cebu for lack of authority to issue administrative decisions without approval of the collegial court. The SC only did not approve the release of De Castro’s internal memorandum last July questioning several administrative orders of Sereno, including the appointment of a Philippine Judicial Academy (Philja) official and provision of travel allowances for her staff. The SC explained that it has yet to decide and act on issues raised by De Castro, which remained pending and covered by the confidentiality rule. De Castro has denied providing information to The Manila Times reporter Jomar Canlas on Sereno’s alleged falsification of several SC documents, including a temporary restraining order on party-list proclamations – as claimed by Gadon during last Wednesday’s hearing. Sereno’s camp reiterated their call for outright dismissal of the impeachment complaint, saying the hearing last week showed that it was based purely on hearsay and perjurious statements. Another Sereno spokesperson, lawyer Josa Deinla, argued that it is not the function of the justice panel to substantiate the “hearsay allegations” by Gadon in his verified impeachment complaint; otherwise the committee will be accused of tolerating the crime of perjury committed by the principal accuser. “The Constitution requires that, at the minimum, the complainant in any case of impeachment must have personal knowledge of the facts allegedly constituting an impeachable offense,” Deinla said. “The entire nation witnessed how Gadon failed to truthfully tell the committee that he had personal knowledge of each of the allegations he presented to (the House). We strongly feel that a dismissal of the impeachment complaint – which should have not been entertained in the first place – is in order,” she said. Deinla said Gadon vowed in the “verification” pages of his complaint that his allegations were based on his “personal knowledge” or on authentic records and public documents. But it turned out in the hearing that Gadon had no personal knowledge on several allegations against Sereno to the point that House justice committee chairman Umali warned him of possible perjury charges. “In the context of an impeachment complaint, verification is required to ensure that the nation is not unduly exposed to frivolous exercises of drastic remedy – a remedy that, in the first place, is only intended for occasional and extraordinary cases to address serious offenses against the very system of government,” Deinla said. Umali said they would accept the charges that are supported by certified documentary evidence even in the absence of personal knowledge of the complainant. The hearing continues today to determine probable cause and enable the House to decide whether or not to impeach Sereno and file the case before the Senate as impeachment court.  — With Edu Punay",

Aside from Banda, the Office of the Ombudsman named as co-accused in the case Gemma Banzuela, municipal assistant for accounting matters.

The trust fund was created by the municipal council exclusively for priority development projects. Anti-graft investigators said Banda used the amount for purposes other than what it was intended for such as paying for the yearend benefits of casual employees, cash prizes for a raffle draw and expenses of participants and guests in a sports event. Banda and Banzuela’s act caused damage and prejudice to the government, the ombudsman said. It recommended bail of P6,000 each for the respondents.

Personnel of the SBMA’s legal and law enforcement departments on Saturday morning went to Comteq Computer and Business College and informed the administrator about the takeover. Earlier, the SBMA expressed concern over the fate of the students due to the school’s failure to pay rent. “It’s because of the students that the SBMA has been giving Comteq consideration. This has been a lingering case of irresponsibility on the part of Comteq owners,” SBMA chairperson and administrator Wilma Eisma said. In April this year, Eisma said, the SBMA issued a notice to vacate with demand to pay against Comteq as the school has been operating without a valid lease agreement or business registration. The SBMA first took over the Comteq facility in April, but the board granted another six-month extension for humanitarian reasons.",

            "content": "ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — After the Marawi crisis, the military is bent on rescuing the remaining hostages of the Abu Sayyaf bandit group by tapping the help of the local government in Sulu, officials said yesterday. Rear Admiral Rene Medina, chief of the Naval Forces Western Mindanao, is optimistic the approach will be effective, noting the successful rescue of eight captives including three Vietnamese and five  Filipinos this month. “We will not state any deadline, but we will try our best to rescue all remaining kidnap victims in Western Mindanao, particularly in Sulu,” Medina said. Rescue operations for 17 remaining hostages – seven foreigners and 10 Filipinos – are ongoing. The military in Sulu adopted a non-violent approach in solving the problem by asking the help of the local chief executives, who are encouraging the bandits to return to the fold of the law.  Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, chief of the Joint Task Force Sulu, explained to local officials and line agencies that the reintegration concept guarantees that any bandit who surrenders would receive financial, livelihood and psycho-social assistance. Sobejana said the concept aims to give any Abu Sayyaf bandit a peaceful option instead of being caught by the military. Sulu Gov. Abdusakur Tan lauded the move to include local officials in the campaign, noting the leaders know their people and the area well, and can negotiate for the bandits’ surrender.  Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command chief, expressed confidence  the focused military campaign would  directly address terror threats. Galvez said that after serving in Marawi, all government forces originally assigned to crushing the Abu Sayyaf bandit group have been redeployed to Sulu and Basilan.",

            "timestamp": "November 25, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has vowed to closely monitor the Philippine National Police (PNP) once the latter retakes the lead in implementing the government’s campaign against illegal drugs. Speaking on the sidelines of a human rights forum in Taguig City yesterday, CHR chairman Chito Gascon reiterated their call for the government to ensure the protection of human rights of all Filipinos. Asked about the decision of President Duterte to restore the PNP’s lead role in the war on drugs, Gascon said they recognize his prerogative to designate the agency he considers most capable of enforcing the law. But he stressed this should be done in compliance with the Constitution and established human rights standards. “We in the CHR will not tell him (Duterte) what he should or should not do, but we will inform him and members of his administration when we see that they transgress human rights standards which he is also obliged to uphold and defend,” Gascon said. “Whether it is the police or any other law enforcement agency that will pursue these efforts of the war on drugs of the administration, we will just continue to do our part as we expect them to do their part in terms of assisting us in ensuring that the public is reassure that no cases of human rights violations are occurring,” he added. Malacañang on Thursday said Duterte was not satisfied with the way PDEA handled the anti-drug campaign. It was a task the President had bestowed on PDEA in the wake of alleged summary execution in Caloocan City last month of teenagers linked to drugs. In a separate statement, CHR – through spokesperson Jacquelin de Guia – said it wants the PNP to show the results of the internal cleansing that it promised to undertake after being removed from the anti-drug campaign. Lawmakers warned the return of the PNP in the campaign against illegal drugs might lead to another wave of summary killings. Senate President Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III said the President has his own strategy in dealing with illegal drugs. “I just remind all concerned and all involved to conduct the all-out war against drugs in accordance with law,” he said. Akbayan party-list Rep. Tom Villarin said the PNP’s return to the war on drugs would be “a reign of error and terror.” “Instead of a joyous Christmas, there will be mourning and wailing among the poor who are the targets of the drug war,” he said. Sen. Panfilo Lacson said police officials have become more conscious, if not wary of possible dire consequences of abuses and other transgressions. Gascon said they are also concerned over the lack of accountability in the conduct of the war on drugs. “The killings are a fact, people are dying. We are concerned that there are no major results from investigations that have been conducted,” he said. He lamented the failure of the PNP to fulfill its promise to cooperate with the CHR in investigating the killings. “We have formally asked the police to give us all the case folders of all cases of deaths arising from the war on drugs, but up to this day they have not turned over any of these case folders to the commission even though we are constitutionally mandated to monitor and investigate possible cases of violations,” Gascon said. Senior Supt. Jemar Modequillo said Caloocan City policemen have learned their lessons from the killing of Kian Delos Santos and Karl Arnaiz. Modequillo welcomed Duterte’s pronouncement to restore the PNP’s lead role in the anti-illegal drugs campaign. “Yes, we are actually ready with regard to that,” Modequillo said. He belied criticisms that the Caloocan City police would be waging another “bloody” war on drugs saying policemen were only forced to fight back in self-defense. –Jess Diaz, Paolo Romero, Marc Jayson Cayabyab",

            "timestamp": "November 25, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Ma. “Joma” Sison would be arrested if he returns to the country, President Duterte said yesterday, as he accused leftist rebels of causing much destruction to the country.  “If Joma Sison comes here, I will arrest him, or if I were him, huwag na siyang bumalik dito (he should not return here),” Duterte said during the alumni homecoming of San Beda law graduates in Makati. “I will not allow him to enter his native land and that is a very painful experience especially if you’re dying and you think you should be buried in your own cemetery, in your own town.” Duterte made the statement after Sison called him the “No.1 terrorist in the Philippines.” The exchange comes after the President signed a proclamation terminating the peace talks between the government and the CPP-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF). Sison has been residing in the Netherlands as a political refugee since 1987. Duterte made the statement a day after he signed a proclamation terminating the peace talks between the government and the CPP-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF). He said he could no longer talk to the rebels because of their attacks against innocent civilians and their efforts to forge a coalition government.  “Even if you talk for a thousand years, we can never reconcile our values,” Duterte said. “I have conceded many and too much soon.” Duterte accused the communists of destroying the country and the youth, an allegation he hurls at politicians involved in illegal drugs.  “There is always time. There’s always a time to destroy and to repair. And they have done so much destruction to the country,” he said. Duterte also ordered the security forces to arrest communist leaders who were released from prison to join the negotiations in Norway.  In a statement posted on the website of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), Sison branded Duterte as the country’s No.1 terrorist for reportedly sabotaging the peace talks and calling the rebel group a terror organization. Sison lamented Duterte’s almost daily rant against the CPP and the NPA “in connection with recent incidents in the armed conflict.”  Duterte accused the rebels of provoking him with their recent attacks on government and civilian targets. Sison lamented that before Duterte’s diatribe, the government and the rebel negotiating panels had already spent several months of hard work in unilateral and bilateral meetings and were “ready to do a little polishing of common drafts” on Nov. 22 and 23 in Utretch for finalization in the slated fifth round of formal talks in Oslo, Norway on Nov. 25 to 27. “The GRP AND NDFP negotiating panels were so happy and confident that they would be able to initial the CASER and the agreements on the general amnesty and release of all political prisoners and the coordinated unilateral ceasefires at the closing session of the fifth round of formal talks and formally sign all these at the closing ceremony of the sixth round in January 2018,” Sison said. CASER stands for Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms. In his rants, Duterte “unwittingly exposed his scarce, shallow and defective knowledge of the peace process,” Sison said. He scored the President for citing recent hostilities between troopers and guerillas as “false basis for slandering the revolutionary forces and threatening the termination of the peace negotiations and the outlawing of the revolutionary forces and legal democratic forces as terrorists. “In the absence of ceasefire between the GRP and NDFP, he (Duterte) through his negotiating panel should have submitted his complaints to the joint monitoring committee under CARHRIHL,” Sison said, referring to the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law. “He (Duterte) violated the mutual agreement that talks would be discreet until there would be good news to announce at the end of the fifth or sixth round of formal talks,” Sison said. The CPP leader said the NDFP has always submitted to the Joint Monitoring Committee its complaints against abuses and provocative acts by security forces committed in the name of Oplan Kpayapaan and martial law in Mindanao.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The peace talks with communist rebels were terminated because of their “pure nonsense” demand for a coalition government, President Duterte said yesterday.  Duterte said he would not give in to the demand of the communist rebels, who have been waging an armed struggle against the government for five decades.  “I just signed (a) proclamation…terminating the talks in Norway between the Communist Party of the Philippines, NDF (National Democratic Front), NPA (New People’s Army) with the government. As it was shaping up during our talks, I already noticed the trend of the thoughts of the other side,” Duterte said in remarks to soldiers at the 67th anniversary celebration of the Army’s First Scout Ranger Regiment in San Miguel, Bulacan.  “And when I sum it all, reading from all from previous working papers, it will sound like a coalition government. That is why I said in the previous days, I cannot give you what I do not own,” Duterte said.   “And certainly, a coalition government with the Republic of the Philippines is pure nonsense,” he added. Duterte graced the event in Bulacan where he was given an honorary Scout Ranger badge. Scout Ranger commander Brig. Gen. Rene Glen Paje led the awarding to Duterte who was dressed in military uniform and donning a black beret signifying his membership to the elite group. Duterte however repeatedly expressed his opposition to a coalition government with leftists, insisting that he should retain control over the military and the police.   On Thursday, Duterte issued Proclamation No. 360, declaring the termination of the peace negotiations with the communists.  In the proclamation, Duterte said the CPP-NPA-NDF “failed to show its sincerity and commitment in pursuing genuine and meaningful peace negotiation” when it engaged in acts of violence and hostilities that endangered the lives of innocent people.  The proclamation also scrapped the negotiations with all adjuncts and organizational units of the communist movement.  Duterte also ordered the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process and the government negotiating panel to cancel all peace talks and meetings with their communist counterparts. Proclamation No. 360 formalized Duterte’s previous pronouncements that he would no longer talk to the communists because of their atrocities against government forces and civilians.  The President had said he would issue a proclamation reclassifying the CPP, NPA and NDF as terrorist groups. Proclamation No. 360 did not contain such provision. Duterte, nevertheless, reiterated yesterday that he now views the communists as terrorists.  “They are always drumbeating about war. I said, Why? If we have been fighting for 50 years this insurgency of the communists. You want to fight another 50 years? Fine,” he remarked.  “Now, I will consider the movement of the Communist Party of the Philippines as a terrorist group.” Duterte said he already did everything he could to reach out to the communists.  “Let it not be said that I did not try to reach out to them. For after all, during the campaign, my promise to the people of the Philippines was that I would suppress corruption in government and I am hell-bent in doing it,” Duterte said.   With the collapse of the peace talks, government forces are expected to run after communist leaders who acted as NDF negotiators and consultants. The government has released about 40 communist leaders who are facing criminal charges to allow them to join the peace negotiations.  “I am ordering those I have released temporarily to surrender or face again punitive actions. You have to go back where you belong,” Duterte said.  “I released you because I thought it might help…then you are undercutting me before the eyes of the Filipino people, ah you must be joking. You must be joking because I will go after you. And I do not really care whatever happens thereafter,” he added.  Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said the military is ready to deal with the communist rebels following the cancellation of the peace talks. Padilla said the AFP had been given marching orders to run after communists and arrest the leaders of the various groups supporting the insurgents. “The Armed Forces will continue to perform its mandate whether you categorize our movements as military operations or offensives, or what have you, they are part and parcel of our mandate,” Padilla said. “People who are identified to have been supportive of the (underground) movement in terms of supplies, in terms of material tings or who bare arms, they can be arrested,” he added. Padilla said all safe conduct passes issued to the rebel consultants are now deemed cancelled.  These consultants are subject to arrest, to include those who were released from detention to participate in the peace talks, he said. At least 17 of the rebel consultants were released from detention to participate in the moribund peace talks. Among them were top NPA leaders, Benito Tiamzon and his wife Wilma. As per military’s rough estimate, the NPA has around 3,800 fighters across the country. They are mostly operating in Mindanao and in some parts of Luzon and the Visayas region. Padilla said the military would be primarily going after the NPAs operating in Western and Eastern Mindanao. The military said the NPA is now operating on 20 guerrilla fronts in the provinces of Bukidnon, Agusan, Surigao, Compostela Valley, and Davao. –Alexis Romero, Jaime Laude, Ramon Efren Lazaro",

Aguirre on Thursday issued Department Order No. 749, after former Manila Councilor Greco Belgica accused Aquino of participation in the DAP mess. The DOJ has jurisdiction over the NBI. Created during the Aquino administration, DAP was a special budget for accelerating government projects and aiding agencies in need of additional funds even without the approval of Congress. Under DO No.749, the NBI is “directed and granted authority to investigate the complaint filed by the Coalition for Investigation and Prosecution led by Greco Belgica against Aquino for malversation under Art. 217 of the Revised Penal Code.” Aguirre also signed DO No. 751 and DO No. 752 ordering the NBI to reopen its investigation into the anomalies in the DAP and Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, respectively. In all three orders, Aguirre instructed the NBI “to form a special task force that will investigate the anomalies.” Aguirre said the reopening of the investigation is “in view of new evidence discovered and presented.” Aguirre also directed the task force to submit periodic reports of its investigation to Justice Undersecretary Antonio Kho, Jr. “We only pray for truth and justice to be served. DAP is a crime that has been decided almost four years ago. Its investigation and the prosecution of its perpetrators have been blocked since then by those who committed it and with many of those who still remain in power.

            "timestamp": "November 25, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte has appointed Commission on Elections (Comelec) commissioner Sheriff Abas as the poll body’s new chief while former justice secretary Agnes Devanadera has been named chairperson of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). Duterte signed the appointment papers of the two on Nov. 22, a move welcomed by the Comelec and the ERC. Devanadera Abas will serve the unexpired term of Andres Bautista, who resigned after he was accused by his estranged wife Patricia Cruz of having undeclared wealth. Bautista’s term was supposed to expire on Feb. 2, 2022.  Abas’ nomination has to be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments.  A nephew of Moro Islamic Liberation Front chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal, Abas was named Comelec commissioner by former president Benigno Aquino III in 2015.  The new poll chief obtained his philosophy degree from Notre Dame University in Cotabato City in 1999 and his law degree from Ateneo de Davao University in 2004.  Abas entered government service in 2007 as assistant regional director of the Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. 12. It was not the first time a Comelec commissioner was promoted to Comelec chair. In 1989, then President Corazon Aquino appointed Comelec commissioner Haydee Yorac as poll chief. Devanadera, meanwhile, replaced former ERC chair Jose Vicente Salazar, who was dismissed last month after the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) found him liable for simple and grave misconduct. The OES said Salazar had tried to influence the ERC’s procurement process so that his favored supplier would win the contract. He was also found to have issued orders to renew power purchase deals without the approval of other commissioners.  Devanadera will serve Salazar’s unexpired term, or until July 10, 2022.  She was solicitor general and justice chief during the Arroyo administration.  Devanadera and 18 others were charged with graft over the allegedly anomalous P6.1 billion settlement deal between the Philippine National Construction Corp. and a private company in 2006. The charges were dismissed after the Sandiganbayan ruled that the Office of the Ombudsman had violated Devanadera’s constitutional right to speedy trial. Comelec spokesman James Jimenez said the nomination of  Abas “bodes well for the commission as the institution approaches the eve of the 2019 midterm elections” as well as the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan polls in May next year. “And with two senior commissioners scheduled to end their terms early next year, it is ideal that the position of chairperson not remain vacant for long,” he pointed out. Jimenez was referring to commissioners Arthur Lim and Christian Robert Lim, named acting chairman after Bautista resigned. They are set to retire in February 2018 after completing their seven-year term.  Asked by reporters if Abas’ nomination does not violate a provision in the Constitution against “reappointment” of a sitting commissioner to the post of chairman, Jimenez cited as “jurisprudence” a ruling of the Supreme Court (SC) in the Funa versus Villar case in April 2012. The high tribunal ruled that the appointment of then Commission on Audit commissioner Reynaldo Villa as acting chairman and then chairman was not unconstitutional. The court declared that the “promotion of Villar was legal but he could serve up to Feb. 15, 2011 only because his tenure should not exceed seven years.”   “A commissioner who has served less than seven years may be appointed to the unexpired portion of departing chairman’s term, provided that the new appointees’  total years of service will not exceed his original seven-year term,” Jimenez added. Jimenez’s pronouncement was backed by former Comelec chairman Sixto Brillantes who also cited Villar’s case. “I don’t think it’s unconstitutional because there are many previous rulings on this. One particular case is the Villar case wherein the Supreme Court had determined that the appointment of a commissioner to become chairman is a different appointment,” he said. Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian described Abas’ appointment as practical considering that the poll body needs to address pressing issues related to its preparations for the coming elections. Gatchalian said the appointment of someone with “institutional knowledge and technical expertise” would provide the Comelec continuity of leadership to plan ahead and implement a well-managed voters’ education program as well as capacity building training for its personnel. The senator stressed the foundation of country’s democracy rests on the conduct of credible, transparent and fair elections. “I sincerely hope newly appointed Comelec chief Sheriff Abas will safeguard this foundation of democracy by exercising his duties with impartiality and prudence,” Gatchalian said. Rep. Sherwin Tugna of Citizens Battle Against Corruption, who chairs the House committee on suffrage and electoral reforms, also welcomed the appointment of Abas. “I look forward to working with him and other Comelec officials in improving our electoral process for the benefit of our people and the nation,” he said. “I think the President considered the fact that Commissioner Abas is an insider and (is) from Mindanao,” he said. Tugna said Abas would know how to plug electoral loopholes in Mindanao, where election results were often questioned in the past. At the ERC, the agency’s officer-in-charge Alfredo Non said the commissioners welcomed the appointment of Devanadera and expressed belief that the industry and the players would benefit  from her appointment considering her extensive experience. Salazar was not available for comment as of press time. He earlier vowed to exhaust all legal options available to clear his name from corruption allegations. Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, Aboitiz Power Corp. president and chief operating officer Antonio Moraza, and AC Energy Holdings Inc. president and chief executive officer John Eric Francia said in a text message that Devanadera’s appointment is expected to get the power industry to speed up regulatory actions and decisions on pending issues. “We are hopeful things will move faster forward,” Cusi said. Corruption allegations in the ERC started after then director Francisco Jose Villa Jr. committed suicide on Nov. 9, 2016 and revealed corruption activities in the agency through his suicide letters. Duterte ordered ERC officials to resign or he would abolish the agency. Power players have been burdened by the regulatory office’s slow processing of permits for new power projects even prior to the emergence of corruption issues. Regulatory approvals can take as much as three years as the ERC also processes cases such as complaints from consumers. Duterte also appointed Roberto Bernardo as public works and highways undersecretary.  Newly designated foreign affairs undersecretary Ernesto Abella, meanwhile, will take charge of the department’s strategic communications, Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano confirmed yesterday. Cayetano welcomed the appointment of Abella to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), saying it would help the Philippines to be more effective in communicating its message to the rest of the world. “As head of strategic communications, which is among the duties he will be assigned to, Undersecretary Abella can be expected to help us more effectively articulate President Duterte’s foreign policy and his directive to serve and protect the millions of kababayan overseas Filipino workers we have abroad,” he added. Details of Abella’s specific functions as head of strategic communications have yet to be released. But in his statement, Cayetano said Abella would be an asset to the DFA as there is much work to do in promoting the country and Filipinos abroad before the international community. Abella served as Duterte’s spokesperson until Oct. 27 when he was replaced by former human rights lawyer and Kabayan party-list Rep. Harry Roque. –Danessa Rivera, Paolo Romero, Jess Diaz, Janvic Mateo",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Shifting to a federal form of government will be a “lethal experiment” that will plunge the country into chaos, according to former chief justice Hilario Davide Jr. Speaking at a business forum in Makati on Tuesday, Davide said changing the form of government will not be the solution to the problems that its supporters seek to address. “A shift to federalism is a lethal experiment. A fatal leap. A plunge to death. A leap to hell,” the former chief magistrate said. “The federal system of government is definitely not suited for our country and people of our generation and even those of the succeeding generations. It cannot fit into our history, culture, character, traditions, beliefs, hopes, aspirations and longings, and even our idiosyncrasies and peculiarities,” he added. Instead, Davide urged the government to retain the current system and address problems without changing the 1987 Constitution. He noted that the primary reason put forth by proponents of federalism is to address the inequality of power that is centered on the so-called imperial Manila. However, Davide said this can be addressed simply by amending the Local Government Code as the present Constitution already provides for strong local autonomy and decentralization among regions. “In brief, effective decentralization or power sharing between the central government and the political subdivisions are already assured and mandated – not denied or impeded – by the Constitution,” he said. “On the contrary, they are hampered or impeded by the failure to implement the Constitution,” Davide added. The former chief justice warned that a shift to federalism would divide the people and push them to have double loyalties to the federal government and the states. He added it would also bloat the bureaucracy and weaken the justice system. “Under this federal bureaucracy, the poor would become poorer. Inevitably and unavoidably, the people would be burdened with more taxes of all kinds to support and maintain the federal bureaucracy,” Davide warned. “This federal bureaucracy carries with it the creation of more juicy elective positions which could guarantee fortune, fame and power to shrewd politicians and their families. We shall have more political dynasties at the different strata,” he added. Congress is currently looking at various proposals to amend the Constitution that will pave way for a shift to a federal form of government. President Duterte has also created a commission that will come up with a draft constitution for the Federal Republic of the Philippines.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Turn yourselves in or face “punitive” action. President Rodrigo Duterte issued this warning on Friday to communist leaders who were temporarily released as he vowed to wage war against leftist fighters following the collapse of peace talks that aimed to end nearly half-century long of insurgency. “I am ordering those I have released temporarily to surrender or face again punitive action,” Duterte said in his speech the 67th anniversary of the first scout ranger regiment. “You have to go back where you belong,” he added. On Thursday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced that Duterte had signed Proclamation 360 formally calling off peace talks that were restarted last year after being scuttled in 2013. It was unclear if the proclamation also made good on Duterte's threat to categorize communist rebels as terrorists. Duterte previously sent mixed signals on the peace negotiations with the Maoist guerillas. He would express readiness to talk to the insurgents after declaring that peace negotiations with them are just a \"waste of money.\" In the same speech on Friday, Duterte, a self-styled socialist, said the “30 to 40” rebel leaders he freed last year in order to restart negotiations were not helpful at all as he threatened to go after them. “Eh kung hindi makatulong then you are undercutting me before the eyes of the Filipino people, you must be joking,” the leader said. “You must be joking because I will go after you and I do not really care whatever happens to you after,” he added. “Why should I continue talking to them? And they’re always drumbeating about war. Go ahead. We have been fighting for 50 years—this insurgency of the communist.” Jose Maria Sison, chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines and founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, accused Duterte of “sabotaging” the peace talks. Sison said the panels had been working on common drafts for an agreement \"after several months of hard work in unilateral and bilateral meetings\" that would have been finalized in Oslo toward the end of November. The common drafts discussed the amnesty and release of political prisoners, \"coordinated unilateral ceasefires,\" agrarian reform and national industrialization under an envisioned Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms, he said.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The presidential palace on Friday slammed United Nations human rights officials for their criticisms of the government's ferocious campaign against illegal drugs, saying that the Philippines would not allow itself to be bullied by experts \"concocting falsehoods.\" UN special rapporteurs on Thursday issued a stinging statement urging on the Philippine government to end drug-related deaths spawned by President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs and bring the perpetrators of the killings to justice. One of those who issued the joint statement was Agnest Callamard, the body's rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, who had been threatened by the foul-mouthed Duterte with bodily harm should they cross paths with each other. Joining Callamard were Michel Forst (special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders) and Diego García-Sayán (special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers). The rapporteurs claimed that many of the killings appeared to have been committed by state agents, an indication of a climate of official and institutional impunity. However, the comments clearly did not sit well with the government of the tough-talking Duterte who in the past took criticisms of his policy as personal affronts and lashed at critics with invectives and tirades. Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte's office, decried the UN officials for making \"negative assumptions\" on the Philippines despite Manila's supposed explanations to the contrary. \"Even as we continue to respect the UN Special Procedures mechanism,\" Roque said, \"we will not allow these biased individuals parading themselves as human rights experts to abuse such mechanism to bully States by concocting falsehoods.\" Roque, a lawyer and Duterte's concurrent adviser on human rights, reiterated the government's refrain that it was not tolerating extralegal and vigilante-style killings as well as rights abuses. He claimed that this resolve was demonstrated when the entire city police force of Caloocan, a city north of Manila, was relieved from their posts following allegations that some of them killed teenagers suspected of involvement in crime and drugs. \"We believe that accountability is an indispensable part of good governance,\" Roque said, adding that Duterte had always emphasized the importance of following rule of law and respecting human rights. On Thursday, Roque told Callamard not to come uninvited to the Philippines after she came to the country in May to attend a two-day drug policy forum at the University of the Philippines where she delivered the keynote address. READ: Palace warns Callamard: Don't come uninvited Though Callamard was not invited by the Philippine government, her visit in May was because of the invitation of a lawyers' group for the event and was not on her capacity as a UN official. Aside from threatening to slap Callamard, the tough-talking leader also challenged the rapporteur to a debate as a condition for allowing her visit to the Philippines. The UN official declined, reasoning that this was not in the world body's terms of reference for such visits.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Senator Antonio Trillanes IV said the impending return of the police to the vicious campaign against narcotics was just meant to squelch mounting criticisms of the drug war following a string of teenager deaths in police operations. \"It is but his instrument to sow terror and fear in the hearts of his own people, so they would praise and worship him or at least won't criticize or oppose him,\" Trillanes said Friday. \"That is what a narcissistic tyrant like him longs for,\" he added. Trillanes said that the impending return of the PNP to center stage in the government's war on drugs was Duterte's plan all along, claiming that the brief hiatus was just meant to \"appease\" public furor over the mounting number of drug-related deaths. He stressed that Duterte's war on drugs was never about the eradication of narcotics on Philippine streets. President Rodrigo Duterte indicated in the past days that he was mulling the return of the Philippine National Police to the campaign for fear that drug syndicates would use its absence to jack up their operations and pump more drugs into streets. The country's anti-drugs agency, which was assigned by Duterte to lead the anti-narcotics campaign after a slew of teenage killings in the hands of cops in August sparked never-before-seen public anger and resentment, welcomed the move as it admitted that it was underfunded and ill-resourced to tackle the problem. \"I am inclined to call back the police and join again in the drug war,\" the president said in a speech Friday before soldiers in San Miguel in Bulacan province north of the Philippine capital. READ:  PNP to return to drug war if problem worsens Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, Sen. Grace Poe and the Commission on Human Rights all emphasized the need for the police to follow the law and due process once they re-assumed the lead role in the campaign. Poe said that despite the cops' return it was the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency which was legally mandated to be the country's primary anti-drugs office. She said that the police should serve as PDEA's main support which would provide \"full operational muscle\" that would fill the anti-narcotics office's lack of manpower. \"We must not forget that the PNP has been involved in too many controversial operations, thus casting doubt on the organization's ability to uphold the rule of law and respect basic rights,\" Poe said in a statement, stressing the need for the police to cleanse its ranks of corrupt and abusive officers. The drug problem should also be seen from a wider perspective, according to Poe, who highlighted the need for it to be considered a health and socioeconomic issue. Pimentel said that it was Duterte's \"prerogative\" to order the return of the cops and to pursue the drug war, one of his major domestic policy programs, in accordance with the chief executive's strategy, a view also shared by the country's rights commission. However, the CHR underscored the need to respect the rule of law and respect human rights in anti-drugs operations. \"This includes demanding justice for deaths allegedly committed for this campaign,\" Jacqueline De Guia, CHR spokesperson, said. She also noted that the PNP was yet to release the results of its internal probe into supposed abuses committed by its personnel. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who has been critical of the police conduct during their time at the helm of the campaign, said that the cops had already become wary of the consequences of their action and the excesses they may have committed.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Ex-Customs chief Nicanor Faeldon was cleared of drug raps due to a weak complaint filed by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice clarified on Friday. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said that the senators are barking up the wrong tree for issuing their statements slamming the DOJ for clearing the former customs chief over his alleged involvement in the P6.4 billion shabu shipment that slipped the BOC. \"It is the complainant that has the duty to submit evidence to prove probable cause against the respondents, that may be determined by the prosecutors,\" Aguirre said in Filipino. He stressed: \"That is not the duty of the panel. It is the obligation of the parties.\" Several senators decried Faeldon's \"clearance\" from the case, as they lamented that the ordinary people get killed while allies are absolved.  On Wednesday, the DOJ released a copy of the charge sheet where several traders and Customs broker Mark Taguba were indicted on drug trading raps. Faeldon's name, however, was missing from the charge sheet. The lawmakers also noted that during the Senate probe, it was established how Faeldon may be held liable in the case. Assistant State Prosecutor Aristotle Reyes, who was also called by Aguirre to address the media, said: \"Precisely why the complaint failed because of the lack of clarity on the part of the complaint filed by the PDEA, and the failure of the PDEA to allege with specificity the acts or omissions committed by the respondents that constitute violation of charges. Reyes added: \"They [PDEA] did not allege which acts, where did they participate, what duties did the BOC personnel neglect, where was their involvement in the importation.\" Aguirre also stressed that Senate inquiry is different with the preliminary investigation done by state prosecutors, as the prior was done in aid of legislation. The senate Blue Ribbon Committee conducted a total of nine hearings on the issue. In its statement after wrapping up the probe, the committee recommended an overhaul of the agency as it found BOC officials, including Faeldon, liable for irregularities. But prosecutors pointed out that they cannot just base their resolution on the Senate hearing, as they are conducting a separate and different probe on the case. Assistant State Prosecutor Joan Garcia pointed out that the PDEA complaint was only 23 pages, and for its reply, the agency only filed 3 pages. \"It only alleged general principles on probable cause. There was no lengthy discussion on the participation of the respondents.\" The two state prosecutors also stressed that they remain impartial and unbiased. \"We cannot rule on something without having any basis,\" Garcia said, adding: \"We will be put into compromise and we do not want to prejudge or lawyer for anyone.\" She stressed: \"We are the NPS. We have no vested interest on whatever outcome of this case, other than basing our resolution on the evidence and the facts presented before our body.\" \"How many times do I have to say that I do not meddle with the National Prosecution Services,\" Aguirre lamented. After a prosecutor or a panel terminates the preliminary investigation on the case, they will draft a resolution that will also be filed to, and signed, by the Prosecutor General. While the NPS is an office under the Department of Justice, the Office of the Justice Secretary will only receive the resolution should a petition for review is filed. Following an earlier issued DOJ order, the dismissal of the complaints against Faeldon and several others \"shall be subject to automatic review by the Secretary of Justice.\" The case stemmed from the raid led by the operatives of the BOC, PDEA and the National Bureau of Investigation at a warehouse in Valenzuela City. Seized in the operation are 604 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. The shipment was declared as kitchenware, footwear and moldings, as it slipped through the BOC.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 5:02pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje-Tang, an appointee of former President Benigno Aquino III, may lose jurisdiction over the criminal cases recently filed against the latter in connection with the 2015 Mamapano incident. In an 11-page motion filed on November 23, released to the media Friday, the Office of the Ombudsman's prosecution team asked the Sandiganbayan Third Division to allow the transfer the cases, filed against Aquino early this month, to the court's Fourth Division. The prosecution said the cases against Aquino must be consolidated with the pending cases before the Fourth Division which the ombudsman filed last year against former Philippine National Police chief Alan Purisima and former PNP-Special Action Force director Getulio Napeñas Jr. The prosecution said that since all the cases stemmed from a single incident, their consolidation is in order to accord the respondents “the benefit of saving time and litigation costs considering that they will appear before a single court which shall hear the totality of the Mamasapano Incident.” “In the same manner, the prosecution will not be unduly burdened with the separate presentation of the same witnesses and same set of documents before two different courts trying virtually the same case,” the prosecution added. The prosecution said the consolidation will also “allow the 4th Division to issue orders, resolutions, or decision which are based on a complete and holistic appreciation of the cases from a complete set of facts with all the alleged perpetrators thereof – accused Aquino, Purisima and Napeñas, all before a single Division of the Sandiganbayan.” Filed by the ombudsman on November 8, the cases of Aquino involve violation of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices and usurpation of official functions under Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code. The cases were raffled off on November 10 and went to the Third Division chaired by Tang. Tang was appointed by Aquino as an associate justice of the Sandiganbayan in 2012 and just after a year, was appointed as the presiding justice besting all the other senior magistrates of the anti-graft court. Aside from Tang, the Third Division is composed of senior member Associate Justice Bernelito Fernandez and sitting member Sarah Jane Fernandez. Bernelito Fernandez, a former Quezon City Regional Trial Court judge, was appointed by the President Rodrigo Duterte at the Sandiganbayan in December last year. Sarah Jane Fernandez, an appointee of Aquino, is the chairperson of the court's Sixth Division. She is just serving as a “warm body” for the Third Division as Duterte has yet to fill in four vacant positions at the Sandiganbayan. Tang had earlier said that her division will be fair in handling the cases against Aquino, assuring that her appointment by the latter “will never influence whatever action that the court will take in the case.” Tang, in an earlier interview with reporters, also said there is no reason for her to inhibit from handling the cases against Aquino. She, however, added that her division will confer with the Fourth Division to study the possibility of consolidating the cases. Filed by the ombudsman in December last year, the cases against Purisima and Napeñas also involve graft and usurpation of official functions. They were arraigned before the Fourth Division early this year, in which, they entered a not guilty plea for both cases. The Fourth Division is chaired by Associate Justice Alex Quiroz, an appointee of former president and incumbent Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The Fourth Division is also composed of senior member Associate Justice Reynaldo Cruz and junior member Associate Justice Bayani Jacinto. Cruz who was appointed by Aquino in January 2016 shortly before the end of his presidency while Jacinto was appointed by President Rodrigo Dutere in May of this year. The cases stemmed from Aquino's alleged act of allowing then suspended PNP chief Purisima to participate in the planning and implementation of Oplan Exodus, a botched police operation aimed to neutralize Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir alias Marwan and Filipino bomb maker Abdul Basit Usman. The operation resulted in the death of over 60 people including 44 members of the PNP-SAF.",

In a press conference on Friday, Aguirre said that a witness, a private citizen, has come forward to reveal the government may have been duped into paying P8.7 billion for a road right of way (RROW) scam in Mindanao. The National Bureau of Investigation was also tapped to conduct a case build up on the information. The justice chief said that the NBI is looking into the \"potential\" liability of former Budget Secretary Florencio Abad and former Public Works Secretary Rogelio Singson for \"approving\" the payment of the dubious RROW.

Josa Deinla, one of Sereno's spokespersons,  stressed that it was not justice panel's job to substantiate Gadon's \"hearsay allegations.\" Otherwise, Deilan said, the committee would accused of tolerating the crime of perjury committed by the principal accuser. Deinla also underscored the need for the complainant in an impeachment case to have personal knowledge of the facts that allegedly amounted to impeachable offenses. \"The entire nation witnessed how Gadon failed to truthfully tell the committee that he had personal knowledge of each of the allegation he presented to Congress,\" Deinla said. \"We strongly feel that a dismissal of the impeachment complaint—which should have not been entertained in the first place—is in order,\" she said.

In his verified impeachment complaint, Gadon, a former lawyer of former President Gloria Arroyo and a defeated senatorial candidate of the Marcos-era Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party, listed 27 specific allegations that he said would warrant Sereno's removal from office. Some of these allegations are falsification of a Supreme Court resolution on the appointment of an official to the Seventh Judicial Region, falsification of a temporary restraining order in a party-list case, delayed action of the requests for benefits of retired magistrates and their spouses and her failure to fully disclose her income in her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth. The chief magistrate's lawyers however said in their verified answer that the allegations were based on \"conflated hearsay\" from \"libelous news reports.\" They described the whole impeachment process as an exercise based on so-called \"fake news.\" READ:  Sereno impeachment hearing highlights Sereno's lawyers also pointed out that Gadon himself conceded that some of his allegations might not be impeachable offenses after all. They also noted that some of Gadon's allegations were presented without any evidence while some were accompanied by proof contradictory to his own allegations and supportive of Sereno's defense. Sereno's lawyers warned that Gadon may face perjury cases for claiming that the allegations in his pleadings were based on his \"personal knowledge,\" authentic records or public documents. They said that during the hearing on Wednesday it turned out that Gadon neither had personal knowledge or had authentic documents to substantiate his accusations. \"No less than the Rep.

Gadon told panel members that Manila Times reporter Jomar Canlas supposedly got his information from Justice Teresita Leonardo-De Castron, who denied providing the journalist with any information or document pertaining to the Court's deliberations. Deinla said that this proved that this allegation was just \"pure hearsay.\" Gadon meanwhile downplayed the denial and said that what was being denied was that De Castro was the one who provided the information and not the existence of the memorandum on Sereno's supposed tampering of the TRO.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Seven party-list lawmakers have filed a resolution seeking an investigation into the use of a long-range audio device against protesters during the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Summit. Reps. Arlene Brosas (Gabriela), Emmi de Jesus (Gabriela), Carlos Isagani Zarate (Bayan Muna), Antonio Tinio (ACT Teachers), France Castro (ACT Teachers), Ariel Casilao (Anakpawis) and Sarah Jane Elago (Kabataan) filed House Resolution 1481 on Thursday. The resolution directed the House Committee on Human Rights to conduct an investigation into the Philippine National Police’s use of LRAD against the demonstrators marching toward the Philippine International Convention Center, the main venue of the ASEAN Summit, last November 13. “The use of LRAD or any sonic devices to prevent protesters from voicing out their demands to their government is a manifestation of the increasing fascism of the government and inhibits the people’s freedom of expression,” the resolution read. Around 1,000 rallyists joined the protest condemning the visit of United States President to the country during the ASEAN Summit. They called for a \"ban\" on Trump, the “US-President Rodrigo Duterte fascist regime” and the so-called neoliberal policies that they say the US is pushing in the Philippines. READ: Protest greets ASEAN Summit kickoff According to scientist activist group AGHAM, LRAD can produce sound as high as 149 decibels. AGHAM chairperson Giovanni Tapang said that the average human limit for hearing without damage is at 85 decibels. He said the intense, high-pitched sound emitted by an LRAD could cause potential ear damage or permanent hearing loss to protesters, police and bystanders within hearing range. National Capital Region Police Office chief Director Oscar Albayalde said LRAD causes only temporary discomfort and is not lethal. He said the device is also used by China to keep Filipino fishermen from fishing in the South China Sea. Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald said LRAD has been used by the PNP in big rallies since the term of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. “Should I allow our troops to just be beaten by rallyists? We have to defend ourselves accordingly,” he said. READ: Scientist group airs concern over PNP 'sonic weapon'",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 3:44pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has nominated Commission on Elections Commissioner Sheriff Abas as the poll body’s new chairman, replacing the Andy Bautista who resigned amid an impeachment case against him. Abas’ appointment paper was signed by Duterte last Wednesday, November 22 and was released by Malacañang on Friday, November 24. Should he hurdle the powerful Commission on Appointments, Abas will sit as Comelec chief for a term expiring on Feb. 2, 2022. To recall, Abas was among the six Comelec commissioners who called for Bautista’s leave of absence and resignation. The six commissioners held a press conference last August, saying they were “constrained to come out in the open to strongly and urgently urge chair Bautista to go on leave of absence for such period as may be necessary or resign for his own sake.” This was after Bautista’s estranged wife, Tish, accused him of amassing about P1 billion in unexplained fortunes, which was not included in his wealth declaration. The House of Representatives decided to pursue the impeachment complaint against Bautista just hours after he sent his resignation letter to the president, rejecting the recommendation of its justice panel to throw out the complaint. Despite offering to quit by yearend, the House of Representatives in October voted to impeach Bautista. The Palace later accepted his resignation effective “immediately.” Abas was appointed alongside Bautista in 2015. Reports cite Mindanao lawyers raising questions about Abas' credentials, claiming he is a young lawyer and allegedly a relative of Moro Islamic Liberation Front chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal. The timing of his appointment was also challenged as Congress was deliberating the Bangsamoro Basic Law stemming from an agreement with the rebel group. READ: Iqbal mum on ties with new Comelec commissioner According to an online listing of registered lawyers, Abas hails from Cotabato City and was admitted to the Philippine bar on May 3, 2005. The Palace also on Friday released the appointment papers of former solicitor-general Agnes Devanadera, who will replace Jose Vincente Salazar as chairperson of embattled Energy Regulatory Commission. Devanadera will serve for a term expiring on July 10, 2022. Her predecessor, Salazar, was dismissed by the Palace last month for grave misconduct and corruption in the procurement system of the agency. Salazar said he would exhaust all legal options available to clear his name. Meanwhile, the ombudsman last year filed graft cases against Devanadera and 18 other individuals before the Sandiganbayan in connection with a P6.1-billion settlement deal that a government corporation entered into with a private firm in 2006. But the court dismissed the graft raps, saying Devanadera's constitutional right to speedy disposition of the case was violated by the ombudsman when it took the agency more than six years to finish its investigation on the complaint against her. In June, state-prosecutors for the Office of the Ombudsman asked the Sandiganbayan to reconsider its ruling.  READ: Ombudsman appeals acquittal of ex-SolGen",

In a message of solidarity to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines’ Summit on Rule of Law, Access to Justice and Human Rights, De Lima said that the country’s justice system and observance of human rights are “under attack.” “They are under attack by a person who preys upon the fears of our countrymen and uses the same fear to seize, consolidate and expand power,” she said, referring to President Rodrigo Duterte. The detained senator said that Duterte’s supposed attack on dissent, threats to democratic institutions and culture of violence against the poor pose as a challenge to lawyers. “This is indeed a challenge to us [..] to protect our countrymen against the abuses and excesses in the exercise of the awesome powers of the state, thus, ensuring that no matter how lowly and humble we are, every Filipino is assured of access to justice and guaranteed of respect for his or her human rights,” De Lima said. She added: “We cannot just be victims of wrongs. We should be champions of rights.” The senator was accused of protecting and coddling drug traders inside the New Bilibid Prision during her stint as Justice secretary. De Lima, who has repeatedly denied the charges, is facing three counts of violations of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.  She is currently detained at the police headquarters in Camp Crame. Last year, Duterte vowed to “destroy” De Lima, who had ordered a Senate probe into the killings related to the government’s “war on drugs.” He also said De Lima “will rot in jail” for accepting bribes from drug lords and allowing the proliferation of narcotics at the Bureau of Corrections.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A hefty P90 billion is needed to bankroll the restoration of battled-scarred Marawi, the city’s mayor said Friday. Marawi City Mayor Majul Usman Gandamra said the P90 billion emerged from an initial estimate indicated in a “consolidated master plan” that was submitted “several weeks ago.” “If we will rebuild Marawi, we will not just restore the city. But of course, we will make it better than it was before,” Gandamra told a press conference in Malacañang. “And of course, no amount of money that can compensate what happened in Marawi,” he added. In a rousing address to troops, President Rodrigo Duterte last month declared Marawi—which was stormed by heavily-armed militants on May 23—liberated from pro-ISIS extremists after two terrorist leaders were killed in a targeted military operation. Four days after the president’s announcement, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana declared an end to combat operations in the besieged city after five months of intense fighting that left the city in ruins. Lorenzana earlier said the Budget Department allocated “about P5 billion” this year for Marawi’s rehabilitation. For 2018, the defense chief said the government is looking into a budget of P10 billion to restore the city. But according to Gandamra, an initial proposal of at least P30 billion is being considered for the start of Marawi rehabilitation in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Gandamra also said the whooping P90 billion is not just for repair of damaged infrastructures and restoration of livelihood in Marawi, but also for the revival of the city’s economic operations. “Because as a result of this siege, almost 100 percent of our economic operation totally collapsed,” he said. A total of 70,000 individuals have so far returned to their homes in Marawi, the government said.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 2:01pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — United Nations human rights experts, including special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings Agnes Callamard, renewed their calls to the Philippine government to put an end to the killings brought by President Rodrigo Duterte's fierce war on drugs. In a joint statement released November 23, the three special rapporteurs urged the government to conduct prompt and impartial probes into the spate of killings, bring perpetrators to justice and review its current policy. “We call on the government to urgently introduce appropriate measures to stop these attacks and killings being carried out,” they said. The special rapporteurs cited the cases that have been reported to them, noting that many of the killings appeared to be perpetrated by law enforcement officials and unknown assailants. “This seems to indicate a climate of official, institutional impunity, which can only encourage further killings and other excessive use of lethal force by law enforcement personnel or those acting on their behalf or with their acquiescence,” they said. The UN experts noted that the Philippine government has an obligation to take effective measures to protect the right to life of its citizens. “Failure to do so is a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,” they said. The special rapporteurs also stressed that some lawyers, judges and human rights defenders working the cases have received harassment and threats. “It is essential that the judges and the judiciary as a whole are impartial and independent of all external pressures, so that those who appear before them and the public at large can have confidence that their cases will be decided fairly and in accordance with the law,” the experts said. Duterte’s war on drugs, which has claimed over 12,000 lives according to rights watchdog, has received strong criticisms at home and abroad. The government has disputed these numbers. According to the latest #RealNumbersPH data release, there have been 3,967 drug suspects killed in government operations since July 2016. Government officials, including Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, said all of those killed were drug pushers. The data releases no longer include information on \"deaths under investigation,\" a tally of murders and homicides that police have yet to determine motives for. Aside from Callamard, the other UN experts who expressed their concern over the spate of killings in the country were Michel Forst (special rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders) and Diego García-Sayán (special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers). READ: UN rights commissioner condemns Duterte threats vs Callamard Malacañang on Thursday reiterated President Rodrigo Duterte’s position against the visit of Callamard, who has earned the ire of the president for her criticisms regarding the government’s war on drugs, earlier this year. “My advice—don’t come to the Philippines when uninvited,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said. This statement came after the UN human rights office condemned Duterte’s threats and attacks against Callamard. “We condemn this treatment of Ms. Callamard and the disrespect it shows to the Human Rights Council that appointed her in the strongest terms,” spokesperson Rupert Colville said. Last May, Callamard attended a two-day drug policy forum at the University of the Philippines, where she delivered the keynote speech. READ: Palace warns Callamard: Don't come uninvited Coming to the Philippines despite ongoing negotiations on her visit was an \"act of bad faith\" and angered the president, Roque said. \"She brought a resource person, who the president believes, stated that prohibited drugs is not harmful to human health,\" the presidential spokesman said, referring to American professor Carl Hart. Hart, chairman of Columbia University’s psychology department, made a statement that there is no evidence that shabu leads to violence or causes brain damage. Duterte has had harsh words for Callamard in the past, hurling invectives at her in August for commenting on the death of Kian Delos Santos, a 17-year-old boy killed in a Caloocan City police operation. The tough-talking leader repeatedly threatened the UN expert that he will slap her if she continues to hit his brutal war on drugs.  The president also challenged Callamard to a debate as a condition for allowing her to investigate the killings. She declined, saying these are not within the UN terms of reference for such visits.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The House of Representatives Committee on Justice, on Wednesday, started examining lawyer Larry Gadon's impeachment complaint against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno for probable cause. In Philippine jurisprudence, probable cause is defined as the existence of facts and circumstances that would lead to the belief that the accused has committed the allegations thrown against her. Gadon, a vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte and of the Marcos clan, accused the chief magistrate of corruption, of violating the Constitution, of committing high crimes, and of betrayal of public trust. The hearing on November 22 ran for more than eight hours. Gadon scrambled to expound on his \"personal knowledge\" of the case as lawmakers probed for details into the complaint. On the last page of a verified complaint, the accuser signs a \"verification and certification of non-forum shopping.\" Part of that verification reads: \"I have read the contents thereof and the facts stated therein are true and correct of my personal knowledge and/or on the basis of copies of documents and records in my possession.\" Members of the House proceeded to grill Gadon on his \"personal knowledge\" as basis of his impeachment complaint. One of the impeachable acts Gadon cited in his complaint was that Sereno allegedly falsifying a temporary restraining order. Rep. Ramon Rocamora (Siquijor) quizzed the lawyer on his source. \"The best person to answer that is the state of mind of Justice (Teresita) De Castro,\" Gadon replied, drawing chuckles from the hall. READ: Sereno challenges De Castro: Choose your legacy He added: \"Well, your, your honor, your honor, please, this incident can be best explained by Justice De Castro. Uhm, I have already laid down in my complaint the incident.\"  During the panel's grilling, Gadon admitted that he has not personally talked to De Castro but was given an assurance from a person he said he trusts. \"You have assurance from the person you talked to, not personally from Associate Justice De Castro?\" Rocamora asked, stressing: \"Who is that again?\" READ: Countering Gadon, Justice De Castro denies giving info to reporter Gadon said that he will name the person \"when we get there,\" but Rocamora warned: \"I hope we will not be wasting our time here.\" It was later revealed that Gadon's source is Manila Times senior reporter Jomar Canlas. The panel said that it will subpoena Canlas to air his side of the story in the next hearing. \"This allegation (draft of TRO as falsified) is based from a secondary source, which was confirmed later on when I investigated, and asked from an, uh, agreement based on authentic records that [were] and based on the reliable information that Justice Teresita De Castro confirmed the report and hat Justice De Castro that she will appear,\" Gadon said. Sereno's team of lawyers have pointed out that Gadon's admission that his information came from \"a friend\" is an effective violation of the hearsay rule. \"Hearsay is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing in question and that is being offered to prove the truth of the matter stated,\" the statement further reads. READ: SC justices, staff and reporter invited to next hearing on Sereno impeachment Rep. Lawrence Fortun (Agusan del Norte) then proceeded to ask Gadon on the documentary evidence in his possession. Fortun implored if the alleged draft is attached to the complaint. Gadon replied that it is not, prodding Fortun to ask if he is in possession of any draft of it. Gadon said that he is not. \"In other words, the allegation that there is a draft sent to the office of the respondent is not based on authentic records,\" Fortun pointed out. \"No, but it can be confirmed by the Justice De Castro,\" Gadon replied. \"But we're talking about now, when you made this allegation in your complaint: Is this supposed authentic record, this case, the draft of the TRO—was that already available when you made the allegation?\" Fortun asked. \"It was already available your honor, however the clerk of court failed to give it to me, saying that it is not available yet,\" Gadon countered. \"Have you seen or read the content on the supposed draft of this order when you made the allegation?\" Fortun said. \"The fact that it was existing but the Clerk of Court did not provide me a copy. The Clerk of Court said that she can't find a copy,\" Gadon replied. Gadon also accused Sereno of corruption for failing to declare the P37 million professional fee she received as a private lawyer representing the government in the Philippine International Air Terminals Co. Inc. (PIATCO) case. Rep. Henry Oaminal (Misamis Occidental) asked him to expound on his allegation. \"I got this information of $745,00 (equivalent to P37 million) in the documents that was shown to me at the Office of the Solicitor General,\" Gadon said. He said that he only made a \"mental calculation,\" since he was not allowed to have a copy. It was unclear why or how Gadon was in the Office of the Solicitor General and how he was able to see a copy of the supposed document. \"They told me that they cannot provide me yet, because what I have seen was not yet final because the documents at that time, pertaining to the PIATCO case, was submitted to the Commission on Audit,\" Gadon admitted. \"What I have talked here 2004-2009,\" Gadon said, adding: \"So in every year's collection, there is very little error on my part (of calculation).\" Sereno, in an earlier interview with ANC's 'Headstart' said that she only received P30 million in the case, and has indicated it in her SALN. Sereno also said that she received the payment in tranches, and used the money for the medical expenses of her loved ones and for building her family residence. The House panel will resume the hearing on November 27-29 to tackle the accusations of culpable violation of the Constitution and corruption. Meanwhile, they would discuss on December 4-6 Gadon's allegations that Sereno committed high crimes and betrayal of public trust.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:35pm",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Activist groups on Friday called President Rodrigo Duterte a tyrant for ending peace talks with communist rebels and for threatening to arrest “legal fronts” as terrorists. In a statement, Anakbayan chairperson Vencer Crisostomo warned that Duterte’s attacks against communists and progressive groups are part of a conspiracy with “militarist elements to install himself as a fascist dictator.” “It is Duterte who is in conspiracy with militarist elements, using the bogeyman of communist ‘legal fronts,’ to justify a so-called ‘revolutionary government’ and criminalize all dissent,” Crisostomo said. He added: “This is not the change the Filipino people want but a throwback to [Ferdinand] Marcos’ terroristic and tyrannical rule.” National democratic umbrella group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) also accused Duterte of “itching to impose an open fascist dictatorship in the guise of an extra-constitutional revolutionary government.” Rights group Karapatan said that Duterte’s actions show his disinterest in achieving a just and lasting peace. “His redtagging of groups, with the accusation of terrorism, smacks of attempts to suppress legitimate opposition to his anti-people policies and to establish a strongman rule,” Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay. Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operators Nationwide, Piston, which Duterte had earlier accused of working with the NPA, said the tactic \"is a cheap and worn-out rehash used before by the Marcos fascist dictatorship.\" Piston said tagging legal activist organizations puts members and supporters in danger. \"We will hold the president accountable if something happens to our officials and members,\" Piston said. Anakbayan's Crisostomo said that the potential crackdown on dissenters is a mark of Duterte’s “subservience to the United States’ imperial interests.” Duterte who met US President Donald Trump at the recent ASEAN Summit in Manila, has said he will declare the New People's Army a terrorist group like the US has. \"I will follow America, since they say that I am an American boy. Okay, granted. I will admit that I am a fascist. I will categorize you already as a terrorist,\" the president said last Saturday. “Duterte believes US backing for his regime will keep him in power amid rising unrest over his anti-people and terroristic rule. But he is dead wrong,” Crisostomo said Friday. The national democratic movement believes that imperialism, a feudal agricultural system, and \"bureaucrat capitalism\" —  the use of government resources and structures by the ruling class to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of the people — has kept most of the Philippines poor despite the country being rich in natural resources. Membership in or support of a national democratic activist organization does not mean membership in the Communist Party of the Philippines or the New People's Army. READ: Why Duterte's 'red-baiting' of activists is dangerous Bayan said that Duterte has “turned his back on the people’s clamor for a just peace” by issuing Proclamation 360, which formally terminated peace negotiations with the Communist Party of the Philippines – The New People’s Army-National Democratic Front of the Philippines. “He wasted the efforts and gains made by both sides over the past two months which include the initialing of agreements on agrarian reform and national industrialization which could benefit millions of Filipinos,” Bayan said in a statement. On Thursday, Duterte formally terminated negotiations with communists, citing the rebels’ supposed failure to display sincerity and commitment to the peace process. “While we agreed to resume peace talks with the aforementioned group and exerted our best efforts to accelerate the signing and implementation of the final peace agreement, the NDF-CPP-NPA has engaged in acts of violence and hostilities,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said. READ: Duterte formally terminates peace talks with Reds The announcement came after the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process disclosed Wednesday that all planned meetings with the CPP-NPA-NDFP have been called off. \"Recent tragic and violent incidents all over the country committed by the communist rebels left the President with no other choice but to arrive at this decision,\" Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza said in a statement. On Thursday, Malacañang warned the “legal fronts” of the communist rebels that conspiracy to commit a crime is enough basis to accuse them of terrorism or rebellion. “Even if they did not physically take up arms, if they are part of a conspiracy to commit acts of terror or rebellion, then they can be held liable under the theory of a conspiracy,” Roque said. Duterte, on Wednesday, declared he would arrest not only communist rebels but also members of non-armed “legal fronts.” But Roque clarified that not all members of communist “legal fronts” will be arrested. “He will be advised by security forces on which of these legal fronts should be charged with conspiracy. Bayan and the Kilusang Mayo Uno announced that they will be holding a rally on November 30, Bonifacio Day, to reject the “revolutionary government” some Duterte supporters have been calling for. Duterte has disavowed the idea after threatening to declare a revolutionary government \"if things go out of control.\" “Our anti-dictatorship action on Nov. 30 becomes necessary and urgent. We invite all freedom loving Filipinos to join us on that day in rejecting Duterte’s looming dictatorship. In the spirit of Bonifacio’s revolution, let us persevere in the struggle for genuine freedom and democracy,” Bayan said.  READ: Duterte 'sabotaged' peace talks, claims Joma Sison",

The C-2A \"Greyhound\" transport aircraft was traveling to the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier when it crashed. Eight people were rescued quickly and are in good condition, but Japanese and U.S. ships and aircraft had continued searching for the others. The Navy's 7th Fleet said details of the three missing sailors were being withheld pending completion of notification of next of kin procedures. The Navy is investigating the crash. The twin-propeller plane crashed about 500 nautical miles (925 kilometers) southeast of Okinawa while bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the aircraft carrier. The Reagan was participating in a joint exercise with Japan's navy when the plane crashed. It was leading the search and rescue efforts along with Japan's naval forces. The Navy describes the Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa as the \"premier training event\" between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations. The Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal naval accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander. The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated 10:29 a.m.) — The National Bureau of Investigation has been tasked with investigating malversation allegations against former President Benigno Aquino III over budget scandals during his administration. The Department of Justice has ordered the NBI to form a special task force to investigate the alleged anomalies in the Disbursement Acceleration Program and the Priority Development Assistance Fund. Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II ordered the investigation into the issues reopened following the submission of supposed evidence by groups led by Manila Councilor Greco Belgica, a supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte and a candidate for senator in 2013 and 2016. The NBI was also tasked to look into the complaint Belgica filed against Aquino, former Budget Secretary Florencio Abad and former Budget Undersecretary Mario Relampagos. In September, Belgica's coalition of anti-pork barrel groups asked the DOJ to open a fact-finding investigation on the submitted records against Aquino, Abad and Relampagos. The documents allegedly showed that P6.5 billion from the P144-billion DAP funds of the Aquino administration were allocated to local projects not itemized in the budget. Aguirre earlier hinted that former Sen. Jinggoy Estrada might become, who has admitted receiving extra funding for projects through the DAP, a witness in the investigation into scheme that the Aquino administration said was meant to spur government spending. Estrada, who made the disclosure about DAP in a privilege speech in 2013, said the extra funding was  an incentive for voting to convict impeached Chief Justice Renato Corona. “I will leave it to the people to create their own conclusion, whether this is true or not,” Estrada said in 2013. “But I can reveal that after the conviction of the former chief justice, those who voted to convict the former chief justice, those who voted to convict were allotted an additional P50 million.” Estrada voted to convict Corona. The senator had been granted bail in his plunder case related to the PDAF scam. In March, the Office of the Ombudsman cleared Aquino in a graft complaint over the DAP but found Abad liable for usurpation of legislative powers. Since the administrative complaint was filed against Aquino after his term as president, the ombudsman dismissed the charges for lack of jurisdiction. Relampagos was also cleared because, the ombudsman said, the complaint against him lacked merit. The Office of the Ombudsman found that by issuing National Budget Circular No. 541, Abad unlawfully encroached on the powers of Congress by effectively modifying the provisions on savings of the 2012 General Appropriations Act (GAA). “NBC No. 541 provided the principal bases for the withdrawal of unobligated allotments which were declared as savings and used to fund PAPs (programs, activities and projects) under the DAP. The issuance of this circular is an act of usurpation. This is contrary to law,” Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales said.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte sabotaged the peace talks with communist rebels, Jose Maria Sison, chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, said Friday. In a post on the NDFP website, Sison, founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, said that Duterte preempted ongoing negotiations for meetings and a fifth round of formal talks in Norway this month. He said that the panels had been working on common drafts for an agreement \"after several months of hard work in unilateral and bilateral meetings\" that would have been finalized in Oslo toward the end of November. The common drafts discussed the amnesty and release of political prisoners, \"coordinated unilateral ceasefires,\" agrarian reform and national industrialization under an envisioned Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms, he said. Sison said the government and rebel panels \"were so happy and confident that they would be able to initial the CASER and the agreements on the general amnesty and release of all political prisoners and the coordinated unilateral ceasefires at the closing session of the fifth round of formal talks and formally sign all of these at the closing ceremony of the sixth round in January 2018.\" Sison, Duterte's college professor, said, however, that Duterte began \"to rant every day against the CPP, [New People's Army] and the NDFP in connection with recent incidents in the armed conflict.\" Among those incidents is the death of civilians in an NPA attack against police officers in Talakag, Bukidnon on November 11. Duterte said the government \"will pursue them to the ends of the world\" for the deaths, particularly of an infant. The NPA took responsibility for the deaths on November 15. \"We hope that the aggrieved families and friends could find it in their hearts, however difficult, to accept our profound apologies. The local NPA unit is already exerting efforts to make amends including extending necessary indemnification,\" it said in a statement. Sison said complaints over attacks should have been submitted to a Joint Monitoring Committee under the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law that both sides signed in 1992. The agreement is the framework of the peace process between the government and the CPP-NPA-NDFP. He said the NDFP has submitted alleged violations by police and military forces to the JMC.   Sison said that instead of going through agreed channels, Duterte \"cited alleged recent incidents in the armed conflict which he used as false basis for slandering the revolutionary forces and threatening the termination of the peace negotiations and the outlawing of the revolutionary forces and legal democratic forces as terrorists.\" He said that Duterte also \"violated the mutual agreement that talks would be discreet until there would be good news to announce at the end of the fifth or sixth round of formal talks.\" On Thursday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque announced that Duterte had signed Proclamation 360 ending peace talks that were restarted last year after being scuttled in 2013. \"While we agreed to resume peace talks with the aforementioned group and exerted our best efforts to accelerate the signing and implementation of the final peace agreement, the NDF-CPP-NPA has engaged in acts of violence and hostilities,\" Roque said. READ: Duterte formally terminates peace talks with Reds Roque's announcement came after the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process disclosed Wednesday that all planned meetings with the CPP-NPA-NDFP have been called off. \"Recent tragic and violent incidents all over the country committed by the communist rebels left the President with no other choice but to arrive at this decision,\" Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza said in a statement. \"Despite this setback (hopefully only temporary), we remain steadfast and undeterred in our unrelenting journey for sustainable and just peace,\" he also said. Peace talks had already been called off in July over NPA attacks, including one on a Presidential Security Group convoy passing through Cotabato province. — Jonathan de Santos",

Actress Alyssa Milano was among the celebrities who spoke about the issue as she urged victims to use the hashtag #MeToo—a campaign originated by writer and activist Tarana Burke in 2007—to share their rape, sexual assault and harassment stories across social media.  READ: 'Weinstein Effect' goes global as powerful men confronted The campaign's effects reached the Philippines as several netizens came forward to share their experiences with artists and local band members who allegedly committed sexual misconduct. Over the weekend, a 17-year-old netizen named Jan Heenan started a Twitter thread sharing her experience with digital artist Justin Remalante. In her tweets, Heenan claimed Remalante, who does commission artwork, sent her sexually explicit messages and tried to hook up with her. Several other young girls followed Heenan and also shared their horrific experiences with Remalante. READ: How to take action if you are harassed online \"I want to make girls aware of predatory men on Twitter who hide behind popular individuals on Twitter to promote his art and at the same time prey on girls here is my experience with him, He's well aware that I'm only 17,\" Heenan wrote. Another netizen pointed out that some girls were already warning about Remalante as early as 2013. And someone was trying to warn girls via AskFM about Justin Remalante as far back as July 2013. \t\tFour years later and he's still at it?

According to her, local band members allegedly took advantage of their fans sexually and committed \"blatant exploitation of labor and skills.\" What they’re also guilty of doing (and they do this quite a lot) is taking advantage of their fans to get them to do over-the-top or sexual favors and acts. \t\tPag nakuha na yung gusto nila sa ‘yo, BYE. Kunwari walang nangyari.

I didn’t really know what taking advantage of me looked like when I was faced with it because I didn’t really think that ever happened to me before.

I'm sorry, but they need to learn to treat women with respect.\" She said she is happy that \"people are finally doing something about harassment and assault, especially in the music scene.\" Enriquez praised the domino effect of the #MeToo campaign, saying \"it is very good that women found inspiration in other women who are speaking out even against powerful or known personalities.\" But she added that it is also critical for everyone to know the laws that might cover the specific forms of sexual violence in order to pursue justice or to seek protection. \"We currently have the rape law, anti-trafficking law (which cover some forms of online sexual violence), and anti-sexual harassment law,\" she said. Enriquez also highlighted the need to pass a comprehensive gender-based online violence law and expand the law on sexual harassment. After the allegations two music event organizers dropped local bands Sud and Jensen and the Flips from their lineup of performers. Coke Studio also issued a statement terminating its partnership with Jensen and the Flips. \"#CokeStudioPH was created to serve as an inspiration to the youth; and will remain as an avenue that fosters a culture of respect and dignity through the songs we create and the collaborations we make.\" READ: Music event organizers drop local bands amid sexual misconduct allegations PhilStar.com reached out to the bands for clarification.

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 8:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Another human rights watchdog on Thursday warned that President Rodrigo Duterte's plan to bring cops back to the government's campaign against illegal drugs can mean more deaths and a \"human rights disaster.\" The Philippine leader has indicated in recent days that he wants the Philippine National Police to resume its lead role in the government's war on drugs, which critics have accused of killing thousands Filipinos, most of them poor. Duterte said the absence of police anti-narcotics operations may have led to an increase in illegal drug activities and in the amount of crystallized methamphetamine, locally known as \"shabu,\" on streets. The government's anti-drugs agency, which took the primary role from the cops, welcomed the move as it admitted that it has too few people and resources to tackle the enormous problem. Amnesty's criticism came after another rights watchdog, Human Rights Watch, warned of bloodshed should cops return to the campaign. \"The return of the police’s involvement in the Philippines’ ‘war on drugs’ would be a human rights disaster,\" James Gomez, Amnesty International's director of Southeast Asia and the Pacific, warned. READ:  Amnesty International: PDEA as lead drug war agency a 'PR' move He said that thousands of poor Filipinos from marginalized communities had died in the drug war since the campaign was launched last year. \"The police’s return to these operations could mean many more deaths,\" Gomez said. Police said they had tallied 6,225 \"drug-related\" deaths as of October. That includes deaths in law enforcement operations and killings that had drugs as a motive. A government #RealNuumbersPH on drug war statistics has petered out from weekly updates to once a month. Amnesty International said that there had been a reduction in the killings since the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency became the lead office in the campaign last month. Gomez stressed that instead of expanding the \"murderous\" drug war led by cops who had shown \"no sign of reform\" the government must implement a health-based drug policy that respected human rights and the rule of law. The perpetrators of the killings, including the cops and their superior who issued the orders, should also be made accountable, Gomez said. The drug war has wide popular and political support. A survey in September found that 63 percent of respondents were \"satisfied\" with the campaign, only slightly lower than 65 percent in a similar survey in June. Duterte has said that he does not care about human rights, which he has at times taken to mean taking the side of criminals against citizens, and has threatened to slap a UN special rapporteur if she tries to investigate the alleged extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, who identifies himself as a human rights advocate, has played down the comment, saying they were were \"addressed to a Filipino audience who are used to the chief executive’s unorthodox rhetoric.\"  READ:  PDEA being ‘demonized’ by Amnesty International – Palace Duterte designated the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency as the lead office in the campaign last month after public outcry over supposed killings of teenagers accused of involvement in drugs and crime. Officers involved in one case — the killing of Carl Arnaiz in August — face dismissal from the service aside from criminal cases. Police Officers 1 Jeffrey Perez and Ricky Arquilita of the Caloocan police have already been found guilty of grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of police officers. Amnesty International claims drug-related killings are still happening, although at a lower rate. Wilnor Papa, Amnesty's Philippine human rights officer, said in a media conference weeks ago that the killings had gone down to between five and nine from more than 30 a night at the height of police involvement in the campaign. Papa said that the hot spots of drug killings still are the same. These include Bulacan province, Caloocan City, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela, which Jose Noel Solano, section director of Amnesty Philippines, described as \"killing fields.\" READ: Int'l watchdog reacts to Duterte's plan to hold human rights summit",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (First published at 11:28 p.m. on Nov. 23) — President Rodrigo Duterte formally terminated negotiations with communists Thursday, citing the rebels' supposed failure to display sincerity to the peace process. \"This is to announce that the President signed this afternoon, November 23, Proclamation 360 declaring the termination of peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front-Communist Party of the Philippines – The New People’s Army,\" Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said. Duterte, who has repeatedly expressed readiness to wage war against the communist rebels, scrapped the moribund talks through Proclamation No. 360, Roque said. \"While we agreed to resume peace talks with the aforementioned group and exerted our best efforts to accelerate the signing and implementation of the final peace agreement, the NDF-CPP-NPA has engaged in acts of violence and hostilities,\" he said. The NDF is the negotiating arm of the communist movement while the CPP is its political arm. The NPA, which has earned the ire of Duterte for staging attacks that killed civilians, serves as the armed wing of the rebels. \"We find it unfortunate that their members have failed to show their sincerity and commitment in pursuing genuine and meaningful peaceful negotiations,\" he added. It was unclear if the proclamation also made good on Duterte's threat to categorize communist rebels as terrorists. A copy of the proclamation was not yet available as of Thursday night. Duterte previously sent mixed signals on the peace negotiations with the Maoist guerillas. He would express readiness to talk to the insurgents after declaring that peace negotiations with them are just a \"waste of money.\" Roque said Duterte has also ordered the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process and government negotiators to cancel peace talks and meetings with the communists. \"The President, as we all know, has always wanted to leave a legacy of peace under his administration. He has, in fact, walked the extra mile for peace,\" Roque said. \"Rest assured that he will continuously pray that we may all find the peace that we seek for our beloved country in the fullness of God’s time,\" he added.",

            "content": "CLARK FREEPORT, Pampanga, Philippines — The National Democratic Front (NDF) yesterday expressed its “grave concern” over President Duterte’s decision to scuttle the peace talks with communist rebels. The NDF said the cancellation of the peace talks came at a time when both peace panels had made “unprecedented advances in forging agreements on urgently needed socio-economic reforms to alleviate mass poverty and resolve the roots of the armed conflict.” “Just four days before President Duterte cancelled the talks anew, the bilateral teams of the NDF and the government initialed draft documents reflecting substantial agreements on agrarian reform and rural development, and on national industrialization and economic development,” the statement said. The NDF is the umbrella organization representing the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) in the peace talks with the government. The NDF said Duterte will now bear full responsibility for the failure of the talks and heightened hostility to the revolutionary forces. Duterte has cancelled all future peace talks with communist rebels, blaming the insurgents for deadly attacks against soldiers and police while threatening to categorize them as a “terrorist group.” The CPP, through the NPA, has been waging an insurgency since 1968. Peace talks to end the conflict, which the military said has claimed 30,000 lives, have been conducted on and off for three decades. They were revived last year after Duterte was elected president, with Norway and the Netherlands hosting the negotiations. Duterte had shelved a round of negotiations in May and informal talks in July this year, citing treacherous NPA attacks on government forces. Last month, Duterte also accused the CPP-NPA of plotting with his other political foes to destabilize his rule. He added Tuesday that he would issue a proclamation declaring the CPP-NPA as a terrorist organization and order the arrest of more than a dozen rebel leaders he had freed last year. Duterte also threatened to tag all “legal fronts” of the CPP-NPA as criminals and have them arrested for conspiracy. “I know your legal fronts. Let us not fool each other. I’ve been there. You are helping each other conspire to topple or whatever, to sow terror,” Duterte told Army troops in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija last Wednesday.  “We will treat you as a criminal, period. And we will arrest everybody connected with their legal fronts. File charges, launch a revolution, whatever you do, I don’t care. I will reclassify you as a terrorist group,” he added.    Duterte, clad in an Army uniform and wearing a bullet proof vest, told the troops in Fort Magsaysay that he is no longer interested to talk peace with the communists. He even lumped the NPA with the Islamist extremist group Islamic State (IS).  “We have the IS. We have the NPA. I do not want to talk anymore with the NPA. I told (presidential peace adviser Jesus) Dureza and (government chief negotiator Silvestre) Bello, ‘Tell the idiots, I am no longer talking to them,’” the President said.   “They are ambushing everybody. I’m losing everyday, all throughout the country, I’m losing two to three to four soldiers or policemen, everyday,” he added.  Malacañang said Duterte’s order to arrest the communists’ legal fronts has legal basis.  “The President is a former prosecutor. He knows that there can be a conspiracy to commit a crime of both rebellion and the violation of the Human Security Act,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a press briefing yesterday.   “Because you can now be prosecuted for acts, overt acts constituting rebellion, also for violation of the Human Security Act, where the taking up of arms is intended for the purpose of inflicting fear or terror in the minds of the general public,” he added. – Alexis Romero ",

Young Filipino ambassadors of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) laid down their proposals during an event in Manila yesterday before their supposed “take-over” at the Senate. Children are calling on Congress to pass House Bill 4907 or the “Positive and Non-Violent Discipline Bill” that could help eliminate the practice of corporal punishment on children especially in homes, “Jophet,” one of the UNICEF youth ambassadors said. He cited the National Baseline Study on Violence Against Children released last year, which disclosed that three out of five people suffer both physical and psychological abuse during their childhood. This could be in the form of physical violence, verbal abuse or even abandonment. Meanwhile, the government must ensure that services and assistance are given to females who became mothers at a young age, another UNICEF youth ambassador “Unice” said. Local government units could create “teenage facilities” that could offer skills and livelihood training and basic training on peer education to help teenage mothers cope with the trauma brought about by their pregnancy and help provide basic necessities for their offspring, she explained in her speech in Filipino. Citing data from the Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study, “Unice” said that 20.8 percent of the youth in 2013 have limited or no knowledge about sex, a 3.1-percent increase from the last figure in 1994. The same data revealed that people who experienced early sexual encounter increased by over 10 percent in the last 20 years. Moreover, the age of sexual consent must be raised from 12 to 18 years old, so as to prevent sexual abuse on minors, UNICEF youth ambassador Jicarl Gopleo said in his speech. He also asked law enforcement agencies to implement in the entire country laws like Republic Act (RA) 7610 that protects children from abuse, exploitation and discrimination; RA 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law and RA 9775 or the Anti-Child Pornography Act. The Philippines is still one of the 10 countries considered as hotspots of online child sexual exploitation, he added, citing information from law enforcement agencies. – Marvin Sy",

The House of Representatives started tackling the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Bill of Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano III on Wednesday night. During the debates, Albano said there have been research done in Israel, Spain, other parts of Europe and the United States attesting to the medicinal benefits of marijuana. He said his bill seeks to allow the use of medical marijuana for those suffering from debilitating diseases like epilepsy under strict regulation by the Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. “The use of marijuana for recreational purposes will continue to be prohibited. We are not proposing that the prohibition be lifted,” he said. Albano added that medical marijuana is allowed in many states in America. Senior Minority Leader and Buhay party-list Rep. Lito Atienza cautioned the House against rushing the Albano bill’s approval. “The proponents must show definitive proof to back up their claims that marijuana is a medicine. Failure to do so would render this bill inutile and defective,” Atienza said. “We are all for finding ways to help alleviate the plight of Filipinos suffering from debilitating diseases. But we cannot do so by passing a law that would allow access to a prohibited drug such as marijuana without any extensive medical research to show that this is indeed safe for our patients,” he said. Atienza said he would like to see a drug allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration that contains marijuana extracts. He added that some groups of doctors here are against medical cannabis. Reps. Seth Frederick Jalosjos of Zamboanga del Norte and Miguel Zubiri of Bukidnon urged their colleagues to have an open mind on the use of medical marijuana. Zubiri said there is a drug approved by the US FDA that contains an ingredient from marijuana. He promised to produce it and the US agency’s certification to Atienza. Albano has said he was optimistic that the bill he filed in the previous Congress “will see the light of day under President Duterte.” He noted that the President has expressed willingness to allow medical marijuana.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos may experience a warmer and wetter Christmas due to the developing La Niña phenomenon, the state weather bureau said yesterday. Officials of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said the La Niña event, although expected to be weak, may bring above normal rain in different parts of the country for the remainder of the year until March next year. “Although this is likely to be a weak La Niña, it will have significant effect,” Ana Liza Solis, officer-in-charge of PAGASA’s climate monitoring and prediction center, said. Solis said there is 70 percent of La Niña development, citing latest forecasts of international climate prediction centers. “If La Niña forms, it is not expected to last beyond March 2018 but varying impacts may occur,” she said. Solis said by next month, generally near to above normal rainfall conditions are likely over the entire country. The eastern section of Luzon and most parts of the Visayas and Mindanao will also have above normal rainfall by January 2018, while the western section of Luzon will experience below normal rainfall. In February, the Visayas and Mindanao will continue to receive above normal rainfall while generally near to above normal rains will prevail over Luzon. Solis said near to above normal rains would continue over the Visayas and Mindanao in March and April. She explained that during a La Niña event, the sea temperature near the Philippines is warm, triggering higher level of precipitation or rainfall and sometimes stronger cyclones. “In general, we will experience slightly warmer than average temperature. The easterly wind is stronger during La Niña, so the northeast monsoon could not penetrate,” Solis said. Easterlies are associated with warm weather while the northeasterly wind is related to cold temperature. Meanwhile, PAGASA hydrologist Richard Orendain said some major dams in Luzon are nearing spilling levels. For instance, he said Magat Dam in Isabela and San Roque Dam in Pangasinan are a few meters away from their maximum spilling levels of 193 meters and 280 meters, respectively. “We expect more rains and we fear that these may release excess water during the Christmas season or by the second or third week of December,” Orendain said. Solis said even if La Niña does not fully develop, there are other rain-bearing weather systems that are expected to affect the country, such as tropical cyclones and the tail-end of a cold front in the coming months. PAGASA said the northeast monsoon is affecting Northern and Central Luzon while the tail-end of a cold front is affecting the eastern section of Luzon. Quezon, Bicol region and Eastern Visayas will have cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms due to the tail-end of a cold front. Metro Manila and the rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers mostly in the afternoon or evening because of localized thunderstorms. – Rhodina Villanueva",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — After eight years and not a single conviction against the 197 suspects in the Maguindanao massacre that claimed the lives of 58 people including 32 media practitioners, the government said the case would be resolved in four years. Undersecretary Joel Sy Egco, a former journalist who took the helm of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, made the prediction after the Department of Justice (DOJ) gave assurance that the case is “moving.” “The DOJ estimated that at the rate the trial is moving the case may be resolved – this is a conservative projection – well within four years or well within the term of President Duterte,” Egco pointed out, as he noted that his office would keep a close watch on the progress of the cases.  “The good news is, after a long and tedious search for justice, we can now see the light at the end of the tunnel. That long period of uncertainty is finally over. Hoping against hope, we expect justice to be completely served for the victims and families of this most gruesome crime,” Egco added.  Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the trial might be completed in a year if the first-in first-out system would be adopted. Under the system, the court does not have to finish the reception of all evidence against all the accused before there could be promulgation of judgment. “We suggested that the Supreme Court adopt the first-in first out (system). If it is adopted, there can be a decision against one or two of the accused within the year. Although there are 58 counts of murder, we only need one to put everyone behind bars. So for me, there is no need to wait for four years,” Roque said.  Roque, a former lawyer of the Maguindanao massacre victims, said he would undertake steps to fast track the resolution of the cases.  According to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, the case will be submitted for decision once the defense wraps up the presentation of evidence. A total of 22 suspects have terminated their presentation of evidence, 13 of which were submitted for decision. At least 106 of 188 accused are behind bars. “In the immediate time, the proceedings only have the following major incidents to conclude: 1) the resolution of the remaining formal offers of evidence, motions for leave to file demurrer and demurrers to evidence, and 2) the conclusion of the presentation of defense evidence. After all of the parties have rested, by then, these murder cases will already be submitted for decision of the court,” the trial court said. Also yesterday, one of the 197 massacre suspects died while in detention, succumbing to a heart problem. Senior Police Officer 1 Eduardo Ong, a former member of the 1508th Maguindanao Provincial Mobile Group (PMG), died of heart failure around 6 a.m. at the Taguig Pateros District Hospital, a source confirmed to The STAR. He was 59. Although the court had earlier allowed him to post bail, Ong remained in detention because he was not able to produce the P11.6 million (P200,000 for each of the 58 counts of murder) needed for his temporary freedom. The court also denied the plea of the PMG to lower the bail amount. He is the third suspect to have died while in detention, after former Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan Sr., an alleged mastermind, succumbed in July 2015 to liver cancer. Noemi Parcon, wife of Joel Parcon, one of the media practitioners slain during the massacre, is optimistic that the families of victims would achieve justice within Duterte’s term.  “It’s been eight years but it still hurts. Although we have moved on, the search for justice is still there. When President Duterte won, we became hopeful because his campaign against drugs would really help fasttrack the resolution of the cases,” Parcon said. In Maguindanao, the relatives of the victims, along with local government, police and military officers, commemorated the 8th anniversary of the massacre at Sitio Salman, Barangay Masalay in Ampatuan town. They urged the government to work for the arrest of the suspects who remain at-large, including Andal Sr.’s two grandsons. Maguindanao Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu, who lost his wife Genalyn, is optimistic that President Duterte will also focus on the arrest of the remaining suspects, adding that some of these men were reported to have already joined a bloc of the Islamic State-inspired terrorists. Others who also lost their family members said they would want to achieve justice before Duterte’s term ends in 2022. “It’s been eight years now and we still cannot see even just a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel. President Duterte is powerful, the most powerful man in the country and we know he can help,” said 87-year-old Marino Ridao, who lost his son in the massacre. He stressed that he wants to see a judicial closure to the case while he is still alive. Mangudadatu, who led yesterday’s commemoration rites, said he wants justice for his wife and two sisters and all the other victims before his tenure as governor ends in 2019. The 58 massacre victims were in a convoy to the capitol in Shariff Aguak town to file Mangudadatu’s certificate of candidacy for governor for the May 2010 elections. Members of the Ampatuan clan, backed by a private militia, allegedly flagged them down and herded them to a hilly area in Sitio Salman, where they were killed using machineguns and assault rifles. It was alleged that Andal Sr. did not want the candidacy of his son Andal Jr. challenged by anyone in the province. To hide the crime, the perpetrators used a backhoe to bury the dead and their vehicles. A number of people who lost their relatives in the incident urged the government to pay reparations and strengthen its support to the panel that is prosecuting the cases. The Center for International Law (Centerlaw), which represents some of the media victims in the massacre, said the government does not have to wait for judgment to pay reparations to the families of those killed. “It is not contested that many of the perpetrators were government officers – many of them local government executives – not to mention uniformed officers and personnel. Under international law, the state must pay reparations for the human rights violations committed by its own agents,” read the statement. This legal obligation, it added, is “distinct and separate from the individual criminal and civil liability of the offenders themselves” and is an important gesture to underscore the government’s commitment to put a stop to impunity. Centerlaw also asked for continuing support for the prosecutors who are working to bring justice to the 58 victims. – Alexis Romero, Janvic Mateo, John Felix Unson, Artemio Dumlao",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Do not come uninvited. This was Malacañang’s message to United Nations special rapporteur Agnes Callamard, whom President Duterte has threatened to slap if she continues to hit his brutal war on illegal drugs. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Callamard came to the Philippines last May uninvited while the Philippine government was negotiating the invitation required for special rapporteurs to be able to investigate UN member-nations. “So what she did to come here, despite the fact that negotiation was still pending, was an act of bad faith. And of course, what angered the President in particular is, on her visit here, she brought a resource person who the President believes stated that prohibited drugs are not harmful to human health,” Roque said. The President was referring to Carl Hart, chairman of the Columbia University psychology department, who said there is no evidence that the use of shabu leads to violent activities or damages the brain. “Now, my advice, don’t come to the Philippines uninvited,” Roque said. Callamard attended a two-day forum on drug policies at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City last May. She delivered a keynote speech during the event, which was organized by the Free Legal Assistance Group. When reminded that Callamard was in the country to attend a conference upon the invitation of the lawyer’s group, Roque said: “Considering there were negotiations ongoing about an official visit to the country, she should have resisted.” “She still made her comments on a matter that should be investigated first. So the position of the Palace is, how could she have come up with conclusions when she had not yet conducted an investigation?” Roque pointed out. He claimed that Callamard had preconceived conclusions about the alleged killings in the drug war. The UN Human Rights Council, through its spokesman Rupert Colville, has condemned Duterte’s treatment of Callamard and has deplored what it described as the “repeated insults and threats of physical violence” against her. But Duterte was unfazed by the criticism, saying Callamard has disrespected the Philippines with her criticisms against his anti-drug campaign. “Sabihin mo sa kanya, harapin niya ako dito, p***** i** talaga hihiritan… Binabastos niya tayo (Tell her to face me here, son of a b****. She is disrespecting us),” the President said in a press conference last Tuesday in Taguig. For Roque, Colville should not judge Duterte for his “colorful language,” adding that the President’s statements should be taken seriously but not literally. “We need to point out that the President’s remarks on Callamard were addressed to a Filipino audience who are used to the Chief Executive’s unorthodox rhetoric… Ms. Callamard, we reiterate, is not a competent and impartial rapporteur on our anti-drug campaign. The way she conducted herself does not befit her office,” Roque said in a statement Wednesday. He added that Duterte’s standing offer to host a global human rights summit shows that he welcomes disinterested and apolitical human rights experts in the country. “We believe there must be a venue for dialogue where human rights, given the wide array of rights it covers, can be discussed from a global perspective and not from the view of politicized individuals,” Roque stressed.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A Supreme Court (SC) justice will attend the next House committee hearing on the impeachment case against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno on Monday to reinforce arguments that she had committed an impeachable offense, complainant Lorenzo Gadon said yesterday. “Yes, she confirmed her attendance to the hearing,” Gadon said, referring to Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro. The House committee on justice, chaired by Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali, has set for Monday until Wednesday the next hearings on the case. The panel is seeking to establish probable cause to impeach the chief magistrate. After getting snubbed by Sereno, the committee ruled on Wednesday to invite her colleagues in the SC to shed light on issues raised against her. De Castro herself was unavailable to confirm her attendance, but an insider who declined to be named said she has accepted an invitation to show up at the hearing. “Justice De Castro will appear before the House justice committee on issues under the culpable violation of the Constitution ground against the Chief Justice,” the source said in a text message. Umali, meanwhile, revealed they might extend deliberations on the impeachment complaint to January 2018 when Congress resumes session, and not end on Dec.13 as earlier announced. “I am afraid that we might not be able to vote on the committee report this Dec. 13 or the day when we adjourn for the holidays,” he said. In inviting De Castro, Umali’s committee cited an internal memorandum she filed in July questioning several administrative orders of Sereno, including the appointment of a Philippine Judicial Academy (Philja) official and the provision of travel allowances for her staff. The senior magistrate specifically assailed the appointment of Brenda Jay Mendoza as Philja chief of office for the Philippine Mediation Center, in violation of Administrative Order 33-2008 that required the appointment for the post to be approved by the SC collegially. De Castro also assailed Sereno’s grant of foreign travel allowance to members of her staff without the required approval from the full court. She revealed that the Chief Justice’s staff members were being given travel allowances even when their trips abroad were on “official time,” which should not involve expenditure of public funds. Furthermore, De Castro has questioned the “long delay” in the appointment to vacant key positions in the SC, a situation “prejudicial to the best interest of service.” The issues in her memorandum were among the grounds for impeachment raised by Gadon in his complaint. But De Castro denied Gadon’s claim at last Wednesday’s hearing that she was the source of information of Manila Times reporter Jomar Canlas for his article about Sereno’s supposed falsification of several SC documents, including a temporary restraining order on party-list proclamations. “I have never released to Jomar Canlas any information, report or document regarding the work of the Court,” she stressed in a brief statement. But Gadon downplayed her denial. “What is being denied is that she gave to Jomar Canlas documents and information. It was not denied that the memorandum exists. In fact, the House already has a certified copy of the said memorandum,” the lawyer explained. Gadon said the House panel is also set to invite Associate Justice Francis Jardeleza to share his thoughts on the impeachment charge that Sereno manipulated the Judicial and Bar Council in an attempt to block his appointment to the high court. The lawyer cited Jardeleza’s speech at the commencement exercises of the UP College of Law in 2015 where he slammed Sereno. Sereno had objected to Jardeleza’s nomination to the SC because of his move – then as as solicitor general – to order the deletion of key parts of the Philippine memorandum or memorial that was to be submitted to a United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal in The Hague, particularly the portion on Itu Aba. The Taiwan-controlled Itu Aba is the largest island in the contested Spratly archipelago. In his speech, Jardeleza said even if he wanted to, he could not defend himself from Sereno’s accusations as he was bound by lawyer-client secrecy and could not discuss in public aspects of the territorial dispute case. “Under our code of ethics, we carry the secrets of the client to the grave. These secrets include case litigation strategy and tactics. You do not telegraph these to the adversary. That would be treason,” he said. Describing his ordeal as a “near death experience,” Jardeleza said Sereno violated “with impunity” laws and administrative orders prohibiting public officers charged with the custody of confidential and secret documents containing state secrets from revealing their contents. “Sharks and bullies can be brutal. I cannot guarantee that you will triumph over the bullies and the sharks. In my case, I almost perished. I was bloodied. But I stood my ground. I pushed back. So that’s my advice to you: when faced with a bully, push back,” the magistrate told UP law graduates in his speech. In Jardeleza’s case, Gabon also cited an SC ruling allowing the inclusion of the former solicitor general in the shortlist for the vacancy in the high tribunal, after being removed by the JBC chaired by Sereno. Retired Associate Justice Arturo Brion even wrote in his concurring opinion then that “CJ Sereno manipulated the JBC process to exclude Jardeleza as a nominee.” Brion had accused Sereno of “character assassination in the guise of a Supplemental Comment,” the release of which Sereno had allegedly timed to make it impossible for Jardeleza to prepare his response. Earlier reports highlighted the lack of support for Sereno from her colleagues in the judiciary in her fight against impeachment, unlike the support cultivated by the late chief justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial in 2012. Judges and court employees then issued manifesto of support and even held “Black Monday” protests. With Sereno’s attendance on Monday still uncertain, lawmakers are considering the use of their “coercive power” by issuing a subpoena to compel her to show up. In a radio interview, Umali said his panel would decide whether to subpoena Sereno. He said issuing a subpoena, unlike extending an invitation, is a show of the House’s coercive power. In declining to attend the committee hearing, Sereno stressed she has the right to be represented by counsel. Josalee Deinla, a spokesperson for the Chief Justice, said summoning Sereno would violate her constitutional rights. “How could the House subpoena her when it is her right to be present in the proceedings and she has decided that she will not go because she thinks she will not be heard anyway?” she said. “If you force her to show up, that will be another violation of her rights,” she pointed out. Her impeachment lawyers claim that such rights were violated when the Umali committee barred them on Wednesday from participating in its deliberations and questioning Gadon and witnesses on behalf of Sereno. They could attend the hearings but could not take part in the deliberations, Umali said. He said Sereno’s lawyers could pass through him or any committee member any questions they may have for Gadon and witnesses. Her lawyers said the prohibition was tantamount to preventing the Chief Justice herself from participating in the hearings. They left the committee on Wednesday after permission to do so was granted. Lead counsel Alexander Poblador said they decided to leave the hearing “because we cannot meaningfully participate and we did not want to participate in the proceedings because it is contrary to the position of the Chief Justice that the cross-examination should be done by her counsel.” He said Umali or any member of his committee “cannot conduct the cross examination in behalf of the Chief Justice because they are not her counsels.” He said they would consider “all options,” including seeking remedies in the Supreme Court. However, he added that they would want the House to expedite its process and send the case against Sereno to the Senate for trial. “The decision to expedite would really be the committee’s, so we are hoping that they would in fact expedite the process. If they believe Gadon has evidence, if they believe the case is sufficient in form and in substance and cites sufficient grounds, why not go to the Senate,” he stressed. Poblador pointed out the justice committee hearings are apparently intended “to provide evidence, which Gadon doesn’t seem to have.” He said he was looking forward to grilling Gadon and his alleged witnesses in a Senate trial, which he added would be “consistent with the rights of the Chief Justice.” – Jess Diaz, Delon Porcalla",

            "title": "DOTr Usec Chavez resigns over MRT woes",
            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Citing delicadeza, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez tendered his irrevocable resignation yesterday morning as he took full responsibility for the Metro Rail Transit-3 (MRT-3) incidents last week rather than put the blame on anybody else or the past administration. DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade, who is being asked to quit because of the MRT-3, traffic and infrastructure problems of the country, said he was surprised by the sudden resignation of Chavez and, contrary to the insinuation of others, he did not “cause or ask” for his resignation. Chavez himself said he was not being used as the sacrificial lamb in the face of public criticism after the decoupling of train cars on Nov. 16 and a freak accident that made a commuter lose her arm on Nov. 14. Chavez’s resignation also came as the DOTr filed charges against nine Cabinet secretaries of the Aquino administration, other officials and individuals for alleged plunder and graft for their supposed roles in anomalous transactions relating to the maintenance service contracts of the MRT-3. In his resignation letter addressed to President Duterte dated yesterday, Chavez said “a simple sense of delicadeza, which I have adhered to throughout my professional life, gives me no choice but to resign from my said position.” “It is also my intent and hope that my resignation provides opportunity for the appointment of (a) person better qualified to perform the duties and responsibilities of the subject office,” Chavez read from his resignation letter as he held back tears.   He also thanked Duterte for entrusting him with the job and expressed his wish for the MRT-3 problems to be resolved properly and with dispatch.  Chavez said he immediately informed Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, who recommended him to the President, of his intention to resign just a few hours after the decoupling of the train cars last week, but was stopped from doing so as it was not yet the right time. But Chavez said he has been in office for more than a year now, as he was appointed on Oct.18 last year and that “we cannot always blame the past administration.” “…this is our responsibility now. In our view, this is my responsibility, particularly as undersecretary for railways,” Chavez told reporters in a press conference at the MRT-3’s depot in Quezon City.   Chavez stressed nobody from the DOTr or Malacañang pressured him to step down from his post.   Despite his resignation, Chavez claimed that the MRT Transition Team (MTT) managed to improve the services of the train system a few days after they terminated the MRT-3’s contract with its service provider Busan Universal Rail Inc. (BURI) and that the latest incidents were “unfortunate.” He said the improvements would have been noticeable if the incidents did not take place.  He noted that the MRT-3 had experienced only one to two unloading incidents when they temporarily took over the maintenance work of the train system compared to BURI, which recorded more than five per day.        “We were just really hit by the decoupling of train cars and that’s where we were judged by the public and the commuters and that is just right, we take responsibility for the inconvenience,” Chavez said.  Chavez, who was the former deputy administrator of the Light Rail Transit-1 (LRT-1) during the Arroyo administration and also a former official of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), said he learned about the importance of spare parts and good management of the train system during his stint at the LRT-1 and MRT-3. “Kung hindi nakakabilli ng spare parts, nagkaka-aberya; kung kulang performance ng management, nagkakaproblema (If spare parts are not purchased, glitches arise; if management performance is lacking, problems occur),” he said.  Chavez, who was also a former newsman of radio dzRH, said he can go back to being a university president or to being a reporter after his resignation.  Although he did not recommend anyone to take his place, Chavez said many best and brightest Filipino experts can work with the MRT-3, including train expert Rene Santiago who worked in the railways during the time of former presidents Ferdinand Marcos and Fidel Ramos.  Santiago, a railway consultant and a former chief operating officer of the North Luzon Railway Corp., thanked Chavez for complimenting his expertise, but said that he would not accept any offer as he has “no plans to commit harakiri” or suicide. “…I am not crazy…I don’t want to commit harakiri and I don’t want to shoulder that problem. That’s Tugade’s problem,” Santiago told The STAR. Santiago said he had told Chavez that the MRT-3 is bound to fail and it is a difficult job before the resigned official accepted the DOTr post. But he said he does not want to blame Chavez for the problems hounding MRT-3 operations. “He [Chavez] tried his best to do it. It’s a very difficult job, it’s bound to fail. Kawawa naman siya (It’s a pity). That’s why I wanted to talk to him. That’s a battle he will not be able to win,” he added.   Meanwhile, BURI’s lawyer Maricris Pahate said she was surprised by the resignation of Chavez, but said that they had a chance to explain their side with Tugade now that Chavez is out of the picture.  “Before we have a problem with him (Chavez), so we are assuming that whatever he is advising that’s all Secretary Tugade knows as well. Hopefully, we can meet with him (Tugade) to clarify our status with the MRT-3,” Pahate told The STAR.   “This mess can hopefully still be fixed and we can work together with MRT-3,” she added.  Pahate said their “woes” started when Chavez was appointed undersecretary for railways.  Reacting to Chavez’s claims that the MRT-3 has improved after they terminated the contract with BURI, Pahate said she did not see any improvement with the train system, rather it has only worsened under the MTT’s watch.  She added Chavez also did not provide solutions to the MRT-3 problems, unlike when they were still holding the maintenance work of the train system. After Chavez’s resignation, Pahate said they will watch out for the next move of the DOTr as it might resort to an emergency procurement contract, which might worsen the MRT-3 problem, especially that there is still unfinished contract with the train system.  BURI had bagged the three-year P3.8-billion maintenance contract with the MRT-3 during the administration of former Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) secretary Joseph Abaya.  Tugade said he was surprised by the very sudden turn of events, noting that he was even working with Chavez the day before. “We have been doing plans and strategies together, up and until yesterday. Even by texts as I was on sickbay,“ Tugade said. Lawmakers lamented the decision of Chavez while Bagong Alyansang Makabayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said Chavez has been consistent in exposing the anomalies in various MRT contracts. Pimentel said the government lost a competent and dedicated servant who also happened to be a member of the PDP-Laban party. Pimentel, the president of PDP-Laban, revealed that it was he who recommended Chavez to be part of the Duterte government. Pimentel speculated Chavez was probably disheartened by the numerous cases filed against him when he was just doing his job as the undersecretary responsible for the operations of railways, including the MRT-3. Sen. Grace Poe, chair of the Senate committee on public services, said she respects the decision of Chavez to resign in light of the continued problems of the MRT-3. “I admire his sense of delicadeza although I doubt that that is the only reason that prompted him to resign. He seemed to be one of the DOTr officials who was determined to fully address all the issues plaguing the MRT. I recall he was instrumental in unearthing the persons involved in anomalies that caused these issues,” Poe said. “However, it is time to evaluate the actions and the leadership of the DOTr as a whole in connection with how issues hounding the MRT have been addressed. These issues should be properly and expeditiously resolved despite Usec. Chavez’s resignation and especially considering the commuting horrors our people have to go through everyday,” she added. Sen. Francis Pangilinan questioned the timing and motivation for the resignation of Chavez. Pangilinan said Chavez resigned shortly after he caused the cancellation of the maintenance contract of BURI for the MRT-3. – Catherine Talavera, Marvin Sy, Alexis Romero, Rhodina Villanueva",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte is bringing the police back to the government’s war on illegal drugs because he is not satisfied with the accomplishments of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), Malacañang said yesterday. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said he is giving back to the police the lead role in the anti-drug campaign to prevent the problem from deteriorating. “Because the President returned it (to the police), he must not be satisfied. He wants more,” Roque said in a press briefing. “I think a decision will soon be made. But like you said, he did make the statement that, ‘I may have to return it to the police to avoid the problem from worsening,’” he added. Roque said Duterte has given PDEA enough time to address the drug menace. A total of 117,268 drug personalities were arrested and 78,619 anti-drug operations were conducted from July to November, according to PDEA data. Some 2,525.77 kilos of shabu or methamphetamine worth P18.9 billion were seized in the same period. The agency has also declared 4,295 barangays drug-cleared since July. Duterte barred the Philippine National Police (PNP) from interfering with the drug war after two teenage suspects died at the hands of Caloocan policemen last August. Policemen claimed that Kian delos Santos, 17, was a drug runner who fought with arresting officers but witnesses said the teenager was executed. Carl Arnaiz, 19, was shot dead after robbing taxi driver Tomas Bagcal, who later disowned the affidavits attributed to him. Duterte has said PDEA may not be able to address the drug problem because it lacks personnel. The PNP was the lead agency in the drug war since President Duterte assumed office in July 2016. Last February, however, the President removed the power from the police to go after drug suspects after some policemen were linked to a series of “tokhang for ransom” and the murder of Korean Jee Ick-Joo right inside Camp Crame in October 2016. After a month, the President again tapped the PNP, claiming the drug problems continued. Duterte again ordered the PNP to keep off the drug war after the killings of the teenaged drug suspects that were seen as a factor that caused a significant drop in his trust rating. PNP deputy spokesman Supt. Vimelee Madrid said the police is already updating its watchlist on high-value targets in the illegal drug trade. “On the drug war, the PNP is always ready, always ready to embrace any task given by our Chief Executive,” Madrid said in a press briefing yesterday. President Duterte said on Wednesday that he has no choice but to bring back the PNP to his drug war. Madrid said the PNP has started plans to revise the war on drugs, but refused to elaborate pending the actual announcement of the President. He said the PNP will try to implement a less bloody drug war, though police operatives have to defend themselves in case they are attack by drug suspects. Since President Duterte ordered the PNP off the war on drugs last month, Madrid said the PNP has resolved 1,000 of the 10,000 cases in six weeks. “We really mean business in the investigation so we can give justice to whom it is due,” she added. PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino welcomed the return of the PNP to anti-drug operations. “There is a possibility that drugs will worsen without the other law enforcement agencies,” he said. Aquino said he does not view Duterte’s pronouncements to bring back the PNP as dissatisfaction with PDEA’s performance, but rather a president’s action as he knows the limitations of the agency. “I can prove to the President that the PDEA did not fail based on our accomplishments and what we have done in the past month. We never failed but it is good to hear that the PNP is getting back because the PDEA is undermanned,” the PDEA chief said. Since Duterte issued the order designating PDEA as the sole agency in the drug war last month, Aquino has always said that he prefers that the PNP and other law enforcement agencies join the fight against drugs. However, Aquino, a retired police general himself, advised the leadership of the PNP to sit down and “reconsider strategies” in the implementation of their anti-illegal drug operations amid allegations of abuse and extrajudicial killings. He noted that the allegations of extrajudicial killings were the reason why the President issued the order last Oct. 11, which directed the PNP, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Bureau of Customs, Philippine Postal Corp. and other agencies to refrain from spearheading drug operations to avoid conflict. International human rights advocates yesterday warned the people of more extrajudicial killings in the country once President Duterte orders the police to resume the lead the government’s deadly war against illegal drugs. Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch Asia Division, said the resumption of police anti-drug operations was not unexpected. Duterte didn’t specify when he might order the police to resume anti-drugs operations that Human Rights Watch research has linked to numerous extrajudicial executions by police and their agents. - Cecille Suerte Felipe, Rhodina Villanueva, Romina Cabrera",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Almost three months after Commissioner Isidro Lapeña was appointed to the Bureau of Customs (BOC), only one deputy commissioner position remains vacant to complete his “BOC DepCom Team.” This was after President Duterte recently appointed former BOC DepCom for Enforcement Group (EG) Ariel Nepomuceno as the new DepCom for Post Clearance Audit Group (PCAG), while DepCom Teddy Sandy Raval was transferred from the Intelligence Group (IG) to the EG. The other members of new BOC team are DepComs Ricardo Quinto for IG, Gladys Rosales (Internal Administration Group), Edward James Dy Buco (Assessment and Operations Coordinating Group) and retired general Natalio Ecarma III (Revenue Collection and Monitoring Group). Both Quinto and Rosales were with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency before they were recruited by Lapeña to join him at the BOC, while Ecarma came to the BOC during the time of former commissioner Nicanor Faeldon. With six of the seven DepCom positions already occupied, the President now only has to fill up the vacancy for the BOC’s Management Information System and Technology Group which was last occupied by former Army captain Gerardo Gambala, who was once part of the Magdalo Group. Last Aug. 30, Nepomuceno tendered his courtesy resignation, but Duterte gave him another DepCom post in the bureau. Nepomuceno is the only DepCom who was appointed by the administration of former president Benigno Aquino III and was retained by the Duterte administration. Nepomuceno has been with the BOC since 2013 and served since the time of former Customs Commissioner John Sevilla. He will assume his new position in the BOC as head of the PCAG (formerly called Post Entry Audit Group) once he takes his oath either before Lapeña or Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III. “The expectations from the BOC are high. We must do everything to meet the revenue targets and stop the reported anomalies in the agency. Gen. Isidro Lapeña is confident about achieving these twin objectives. We will help him. I’m personally committed to assist him. He is on the right track,” Nepomuceno told The STAR. The PEAG was previously under the Department of Finance but some two months ago, an Executive Order was issued returning the PEAG/PCAG to the BOC in compliance with the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act. At the PCAG, Nepomuceno said his office would be tasked to check shipments that had passed through the BOC for the last three years. “Its main function is to audit or double check all the transactions undertaken by the BOC as far as payment of correct duties and taxes is concerned,” he added. In the BOC, for purposes of trade facilitation, there are instances when selected shipments are released with minimal scrutiny, but through the PCAG, the government can run after those who failed to give accurate payments of duties and taxes.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Even though cleared of charges, former Bureau of Customs (BOC) chief Nicanor Faeldon has no intention of pulling out from the custody of the Senate, his lawyer said yesterday. Jose Diño said no request has been made to either the Senate or the Blue Ribbon committee to release his client, who has been detained since Sept. 12. “We have not asked the Senate, specifically the Senate Blue Ribbon committee, nor will we ever request it to release Captain Faeldon despite the vindication that we received based on news reports that the DOJ (Department of Justice) has absolved us from any liabilities,” Diño said. According to Diño, Faeldon decided to remain incarcerated in the Senate as a statement against legislative investigations “in aid of persecution.” Faeldon was detained for refusing to take part in the Blue Ribbon committee’s hearings on the P6.4-billion shabu shipment from China. The DOJ has dropped the drug trading charges against Faeldon over the P6.4-billion shabu shipment that slipped past the BOC. The DOJ said the charges against Faeldon and several other BOC officials were dropped due to the failure of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to clarify the offense committed by the respondents to constitute the offense charged. Diño said there was no evidence to support the allegations that his client was involved in any wrongdoing, including the P6.4-billion shabu shipment from China or the alleged P100-million pasalubong (welcome gift) that Sen. Panfilo Lacson claimed Faeldon received upon his assumption at the helm of the BOC. He said some senators have already prejudged Faeldon as guilty so he has no intention of participating in the hearings. Diño said Faeldon has no intention of being subjected to lies and vilification and does not mind remaining in detention at the Senate even on Christmas Day. In the draft committee report prepared by Blue Ribbon committee chairman Sen. Richard Gordon, Faeldon was found liable for gross negligence as head of the BOC. “He imposed a military structure which was good, but the concomitant diligence and competence was sorely lacking. We, therefore, hold him responsible as specified above,” the report stated. “He recommended the hiring of (Gerardo) Gambala as deputy commissioner for management information system and technology. He too was grossly negligent and therefore his appointment and competence is Faeldon’s direct responsibility,” it added. A total of 12 senators have signed the draft committee report, which has not yet been reported out in plenary. Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon abstained from signing since he has yet to read the report. Former BOC-Manila International Container Port chief Vincent Philip Maronilla, who was among those cleared by the DOJ, said the lack of solid evidence against him was the reason why the charges were dismissed.",

            "timestamp": "November 24, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Senators aired their disappointment after the prosecutors of the Department of Justice (DOJ) cleared former Bureau of Customs (BOC) chief Nicanor Faeldon and several of his subordinates of drug trafficking charges in relation to the P6.4-billion shabu smuggling incident earlier this year. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, the chairman of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, said it was clear to him and the other legislators who attended the congressional hearings on the shabu shipment that there was no way the illegal drugs could have been released without the knowledge of the officials of the BOC. “Many among us who participated and witnessed the Senate and the lower house hearings on the smuggled P6.4-billion shabu shipment that passed through our country’s Customs house under the noses of those tasked to check on smuggling are shocked and angered by the dismissal of the case against all the BOC personnel,” Lacson said. Apart from the shabu smuggling case, Lacson has also gone after the officials and employees of the BOC for their alleged corrupt activities, which he said were rampant within the agency. In a privilege speech last August, Lacson claimed that Faeldon was given a P100-million welcome gift when he was named BOC commissioner by President Duterte. “It is unimaginable if not impossible that the drug shipment would reach its destination in Valenzuela City without the participation and complicity of the BOC personnel involved,” Lacson said.  “Simple logic will tell us that at the very least those under whose watch the drug shipment passed through should be held criminally liable as well. RA 9165 is quite clear in this regard,” he said. Lacson said that he is pinning his hopes on Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II to “put some sense into a reasonable disposition of this case” when the findings of the panel is elevated to his office for an automatic review. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III said it would be illogical for a smuggling incident of this size to succeed without the involvement of any of the people of the BOC. “How could such a big shipment, 600-plus kilos of shabu, and in an organized way, get past the Customs without the involvement of Customs,” Pimentel said. “So there must be somebody there from the inside who facilitated the release of the shipment,” he added. Pimentel said he intends to raise the matter with Aguirre, who is a member of the PDP-Laban, of which he is president. “I think I have many questions for him. I will talk to Secretary Aguirre for an explanation because he’s a partymate. Number one, why wasn’t Faeldon and many of his subordinates included (in the case)?” Pimentel said. “And even with the Bangladesh money fraud, I think even Philrem was not charged. I need to know why. So the questions I have for Secretary Aguirre are building up,” he added. Sen. Paolo Benigno Aquino IV said he was shocked by the findings of the DOJ panel when it was clear to him and everyone who followed the Senate hearings that the BOC was involved in the smuggling case. “It takes two to tango. Whether they were directly involved in smuggling it or because of corruption, whatever the case, they are liable for the entry of drugs into the country,” Aquino said. Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the panel’s findings on the shabu smuggling incident only reinforces his observation that the administration is persecuting its critics while coddling its allies. “Gaguhan na talaga! Kapag kakampi pinapalusot. Kapag katunggali iniipit. Ang lakas naman ng mga ito (We’re being fooled. They clear their allies while they charge their enemies),” Pangilinan said. “And I thought they are against illegal drugs? If it involves the common people with a small amount of shabu, they kill them. But when it comes to tons of shabu, they clear them. The drug war of the administration is a sham,” he added. Sen. Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee that led the inquiry into the shabu smuggling incident, said he disagrees partly with the findings of the DOJ panel. “Faeldon and (deputy BOC commissioner Gerardo) Gambala may have been absolved in the importation of dangerous drugs but they are guilty of misfeasance and nonfeasance in allowing the entry of drugs through the green lane,” Gordon said. “They may be held liable for violating RA 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and RA 10863, otherwise known as the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act. They centralized the operation by creating the Command Center (ComCen), thereby causing undue injury to the government,” he added. Gordon said said that former BOC director Milo Maestrocampo should be investigated further. “Maestrecampo, on the other hand, is guilty of malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance. Based on the hearings conducted by the Senate, the evidence shows that Maestrecampo provided aid in allowing the shipment of drugs entry in the country’s front doors smoothly through the green lane,” Gordon said.     “There is also evidence showing Maestrecampo’s involvement with Mark Taguba. What about Neil Estrella? He was the one who botched the seizure operations – facts pointed to the failure to have been done deliberately,” he added. Taguba, who was described as a fixer at the BOC, was found liable by the panel while Estrella, who is the agency’s Investigation and Intelligence Service chief, was cleared.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Duterte has appointed his former spokesman Ernesto Abella as foreign affairs undersecretary. Abella was given his new assignment last Oct. 27, his appointment paper showed. The appointment paper did not specify Abella’s portfolio. A source previously told reporters that the former presidential spokesman would handle the foreign affairs department’s strategic communications. Duterte designated Abella as his spokesman days before he assumed the presidency. Abella witnessed Duterte’s leadership firsthand in 1996, when he was kidnapped by rebels in Davao City. He was freed because of the intervention of Duterte, who was then mayor of the southern city. Earlier this month, Duterte replaced Abella as presidential spokesman but was tight-lipped on his reasons for doing so.  There have been rumors that Duterte was not happy with the way Abella handled reports about his lower survey numbers and his criticisms against the European Union. Human rights lawyer and former lawmaker Harry Roque succeeded Abella as presidential spokesman. Duterte has also appointed Roque as presidential adviser on human rights. Roque will hold the post in concurrent capacity. “Being appointed recently as presidential adviser on human rights concurrent with my being the presidential spokesperson, I will take steps to ensure that the Philippines discharges its obligations in protecting and promoting human rights, especially the right to life,” Roque said in a statement issued last Wednesday. Roque has drawn flak for agreeing to become the spokesman of Duterte, who was accused of tolerating extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. Opposition Sen. Leila de Lima, who is detained at the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame on drug trafficking charges, has called Roque a “political manipulator” and a “propaganda artist” of Duterte. Commission on Human Rights Commissioner Roberto Cadiz has also described Roque as “a big disappointment to the human rights community.” Roque has shrugged off the criticisms against him and has vowed to continue advocating human rights as presidential spokesman.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — She was busy “doing the rounds of public forums” but couldn’t find time to attend hearings on her impeachment, lawyer Lorenzo Gadon said of Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, whom he accused of deliberately ignoring an invitation from the House committee on justice to personally confront her accuser. “Why is CJ Sereno skipping House hearings when she has all the time doing the rounds in public forums?” Gadon said, referring to her absence at the hearing on her impeachment by the House committee on justice last Wednesday. “Is the CJ afraid of displaying her litigation skills or lack of it? Is she avoiding the public to feast on the spectacle of no less than the Chief Justice lacking in the basic skills of litigation – unlike any experienced lawyer?” Gadon stressed. He added Sereno’s frequent media interviews belied claims by her lawyers that she was busy attending to her duties in the judiciary. “CJ Sereno claims she wants to focus on her duties in the SC, but why is she everywhere else discussing her case in media interviews?” he asked. Gadon earlier accused Sereno of turning to the public for support after failing to get it from the judiciary. In response, the camp of Sereno argued speaking in public forums is part of the Chief Justice’s duties. “Conducting media interviews and attending public forums, inasmuch as they would make an informed citizenry and promote the respect for the rule of law, are also duties of the Chief Justice,” said lawyer Josa Deinla, one of Sereno’s spokespersons. “Would the complainant further want to muzzle the Chief Justice in these public places?”  After her interviews with ANC Headstart and GMA News TV’s “Bawal Ang Pasaway Kay Mareng Winnie” last Monday, the Chief Justice appeared in two forums yesterday. She was keynote speaker at the Integrated Bar of the Philippines’ Pagtugon sa Hamon forum in Taguig City in the morning and was also speaker at the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ 72nd Annual Convention in Pasay City in the afternoon. In her speech, Sereno called on lawyers to do their part in fighting impunity and human rights violations in “these dangerous times.” She asked them not to allow themselves to be “stymied, muzzled or cowed” and that they should “let no political ambition stand in the way of standing for what is right.” “Make your stand in such a way that no one will doubt that your hearts are with the Filipino people. Let your voices be heard clearly, as a call to our people to unite and defend the freedoms that our forefathers dearly paid with blood for,” Sereno said. – Jess Diaz",

We are aware that the President is capable of creating scenarios to declare nationwide martial law, but we will not be intimidated,” Migrante International spokesman Arman Hernando said in a statement. According to Hernando, the continuing harassment and persecution of activist leaders and organizations as well as the cancelation of talks with the communist groups are clear moves by Duterte to install himself as a fascist dictator like the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos. Hernando said Migrante and other groups are prepared to mobilize people in the country and overseas to force Duterte to step down. Migrante also criticized the Duterte government for the violent dispersal of the homeless and members of the urban poor group Kadamay during a rally in front of the National Housing Authority (NHA) yesterday. The violent dispersal by the Philippine National Police (PNP) resulted in the arrest of Migrante member Paul Reyes and injury to a number of protesters. Migrante is planning to file counter-charges against the PNP as Reyes allegedly suffered police beating during the incident. According to Hernando, Migrante supports the call for decent and affordable housing for the poor. He said the Duterte administration has neglected the poor. President Duterte has doused fears that he would declare a revolutionary government to counter supposed threats to his administration. “There will be no revolutionary government. I will assure you that I can enforce the law,” Duterte said on Wednesday night. The President earlier said the establishment of a revolutionary government would be a last resort should things turn chaotic.",

Umali said that the committee would invite Supreme Court Justice Teresita Leonardo-De Castro who he said could clarify Gadon's allegation that Sereno falsified a temporary restraining order in a case of a party-list against the Commission on Elections. \"I hope Justice De Castro attends because she can shed light on these issues.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency welcomes the return of the Philippine National Police as the lead agency in the government's campaign against illegal drugs, admitting that it did not have enough resources to fight the drug problem. In a statement, PDEA said that it has been its desire for the PNP to re-assume the lead role in the government's campaign against illicit drugs as it admitted that it did not have enough resources to combat the problem. \"PDEA has repeatedly admitted that it is undermanned, under budget and under equipped, hence, the need for other law enforcement agencies particularly the PNP,\" it said. PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino also welcomed the news and vowed that they would respect and adhere to the decision of President Rodrigo Duterte on the matter. \"We respect and we adhere to the decision of the president. It's a welcome decision. It's a welcome news for us,\" he said in an interview on ANC. He emphasized that the lead agency in the campaign did not matter for as long as they were united in the fight against illegal drugs in the country. He said that Duterte did not give any specific instructions or advice on the drug war upon PDEA's assumption of the lead role in the campaign as the chief executive knew what they were doing. READ:  Bato: If war on drugs fails, bring us back He said that during budget deliberations he asked Congress to provide the anti-drugs agency additional funding of between P2.4 to P2.5 billion for equipment, training and hiring of new personnel. With the budget, they were hoping to hire 1,000 more agents, a number which Aquino admitted was still not enough considering the enormity of the problem. On Tuesday, Duterte showed that he was bent on bringing the cops back in the ferocious campaign against drugs accused of killing thousands of mostly urban poor Filipinos. Speaking before soldiers, the chief executive said that the PNP should be involved in the brutal crackdown to prevent further proliferation of methamphetamine or shabu. “But as of now, just to parry, I placed it under PDEA. But whether I like it or not, I have to return that power to the police because surely, it will increase the activity of the shabu,” he said. The president admitted that PDEA had not been able to solve the country's drug problems because it lacked the manpower needed to combat the menace. He said that the agency had only 2,000 personnel nationwide. It was not clear however if the president had made any moves to address PDEA's lack of resources to enable it to lead the campaign. The president issued a memorandum in October transferring the lead role to PDEA following the public outcry over the killing of teenage suspects in anti-crime operations in Caloocan City in August.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte was perhaps not pleased with the accomplishments of Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in leading his anti-narcotics campaign, Malacañang said Thursday after the leader revealed he might bring back the police to the frontline of the drug war. Duterte last October designated the PDEA as “sole agency” in charge of his controversial war on drugs after his satisfaction rating significantly dropped following street protests triggered by the death of minors in the hands of Caloocan City cops. But on Wednesday, the president said the Philippine National Police has to be involved in the crackdown to prevent the proliferation of methamphetamine or shabu. “He (Duterte) must not be satisfied. He wants more,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said when asked how he would assess PDEA’s achievements in heading the drug war. Roque, who had flaunted PDEA’s efforts in his recent press briefings, said there is a “very strong likelihood” that the police will regain control of the war on drugs considering Duterte’s latest pronouncements. “I think a decision will soon be made...  Effectively, he has manifested already a decision to return it to the PNP,” the Palace spokesman said. Duterte, who easily won the race to Malacañang last year on a brutal law-and-order platform, has stoked international alarm for activating his fierce anti-drug campaign. Early this year, Duterte was forced to suspend Oplan Tokhang—a portmanteau of two words meaning to “knock” and “plead”—following the kidnapping and killing of a South Korean businessman by rogue policemen. At that time, Duterte stripped the PNP of the authority to conduct anti-illegal drug operations and designated the PDEA—backed by the Army—to continue the campaign. He had also abolished the anti-drug units of the PNP and vowed to cleanse the police force, which he described as “corrupt to the core.” Citing lack of manpower in the anti-narcotics operations, the firebrand leader later decided to tap the police again in his deadly war against illegal drugs. READ: Duterte brings back police into war on drugs Asked why the President is bent on bringing back the police to his brutal drug war despite his previous admission the force was corrupt, Roque said: “I think the President has acknowledged that the PNP is not a perfect organization.” “But he has also said that, by and large, not everyone in the PNP is corrupt. And therefore, he still believes in the institution.” READ: Amnesty International: PDEA as lead drug war agency a 'PR' move",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang on Thursday sought to defend the reappointment of two former Bureau of Customs officials accused of corruption, saying they must have already been cleared from allegations of receiving bribes from smugglers. The Palace on Wednesday released the appointment papers of Ariel Nepomuceno and Teddy Raval. Both were designated as deputy commissioner, the same post they previously held. Nepomuceno and Raval were among the Customs officials accused by Sen. Panfilo Lacson of receiving money from smugglers in exchange for release of illegal shipment.  Asked why President Rodrigo Duterte, who vowed not to tolerate even a whiff of corruption in government, reassigned the two officials, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said their reappointment indicated they were found not guilty of corruption. “It must be because there has been thorough investigation conducted by the House, the Senate, the DOJ (Department of Justice), and even from within the Palace,” Roque said. “And it must be because these two officials were found not to be in anyway involved in the 6.4-billion scandal,” he added. The Customs bureau was placed in hot water this year after it was discovered that P6.4 billion worth of shabu from China was able to enter the country. The scandal paved the way for a series of exposes about the supposed systemic corruption in the agency.  Early this month, Duterte had also given new positions to former Customs Import Assessment Service director Milo Maestrecampo and former deputy commissioner Gerardo Gambala. Lacson had also accused Maestrecampo and Gambala of receiving grease money. Maestrecampo was appointed assistant director general II of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines while Gambala was named director IV of the Office for Transportation Security. The Customs officials had denied engaging in any form of corruption. ",

            "content": "TOKYO  — U.S. and Japanese ships and aircraft were searching in the Philippine Sea on Thursday for three sailors missing since a U.S. Navy aircraft crashed a day earlier. Eight people were rescued about 40 minutes after the crash of the C-2 \"Greyhound\" transport aircraft Wednesday afternoon, the Navy said. They were taken aboard the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and were in good condition. The C-2A twin-propeller plane came down about 500 nautical miles (925 kilometers) southeast of Okinawa as it was bringing passengers and cargo from Japan to the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, the Navy said in a statement. The cause wasn't clear but the crash would be investigated, the Navy said. The Reagan was participating in a joint exercise with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force when the plane crashed. The aircraft carrier was leading the search and rescue efforts along with Japan's naval forces. The ships and aircraft had searched more than 320 nautical miles as of Thursday morning, the Navy said. Japan's Defense Ministry said the crash site is about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Okinotorishima, a Japanese atoll. The Navy said it had notified next of kin that the three sailors were \"whereabouts unknown\" but it would delay releasing their identities publicly for three days due to policy. In Washington, the White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the crash. Trump said in a tweet: \"We are monitoring the situation. Prayers for all involved.\" The Nov. 16-26 joint exercise in waters off Okinawa has been described by the Navy as the \"premier training event\" between the U.S. and Japanese navies, designed to increase defensive readiness and interoperability in air and sea operations. The Navy's Japan-based 7th Fleet has had two fatal accidents in Asian waters this year, leaving 17 sailors dead and prompting the removal of eight top Navy officers from their posts, including the 7th Fleet commander. The USS John S. McCain and an oil tanker collided near Singapore in August, leaving 10 U.S. sailors dead. Seven sailors died in June when the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship collided off Japan. The Navy has concluded that the collisions were avoidable and resulted from widespread failures by the crews and commanders, who didn't quickly recognize and respond to unfolding emergencies. A Navy report recommended numerous changes to address the problems, ranging from improved training to increasing sleep and stress management for sailors.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The lawyers of embattled Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno on Thursday blasted what they criticized as a \"fishing expedition\" by lawyer Lorenzo Gadon at a House of Representatives hearing on the probable cause of the impeachment case against her. Sereno spokesperson Josa Deinla said that Wednesday's hearing by the House Justice Committee was marked by requests from Gadon to subpoena witnesses and documents, a proof that the lawyer did not have sufficient evidence to support his allegations against the chief magistrate. “It is pretty clear that Mr. Gadon’s allegations have no strong and solid bases, owing to his failure to provide the justice committee with evidence he claimed to have personal knowledge of,” Deinla said. “We are right from the beginning that his impeachment complaint was nothing but garbage and should have not been entertained in the first place,” she said. READ: Sereno spokesman: Impeachment based on 'double hearsay' The chief magistrate's spokesman stressed that the House of Representatives should not allow public money to fund Gadon's fishing expedition, which Deina described an \"appalling\" search for evidence. She called on Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali to prevent Gadon from \"[putting] the cart before the horse and get away with it.\" “Mr. Gadon’s resorting to fishing expedition, with the aid of some members of the committee, served to highlight one crucial fact—there is no solid evidence and sufficient grounds for impeachment against the Chief Justice,” Deinla said. READ:  Unable to defend Sereno at House, lawyers want case taken to Senate Sereno is accused of 27 acts which allegedly are tantamount to impeachable offenses such as culpable violation of the Constitution (11 acts), corruption (three acts), other high crimes (four acts) and betrayal of public trust (nine acts). Some of the allegations against the chief justice are falsification of a Supreme Court resolution designating the head of the Judiciary Decentralized Office in the Seventh Judicial Region, falsification of a temporary restraining order in the case of a party-list against the COMELEC, falsification of the resolution of the Court on the allegation of involvement of four incumbent judges in the drug trade, delayed action on the petitions for retirement benefits of judges and justices and their surviving spouses and failure to declare some of her wealth in her Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth. Even some members of the House noticed some of Gadon's omissions in his case such as his failure to specify the years covered by his allegations pertaining to the SALN of Sereno. “At first glance, with due respect to this committee, it seems that we are now on a fishing expedition because we do not have a definite year of SALN,” Rep. Rodel Batocabe of Ako Bicol Party-list said. Rep. Jose Christopher \"Kit\" Belmonte made the same observation and said that Gadon seemed to be using the justice committee hearing to obtain the evidence to back up his allegations. \"I'd like to stress to my good friend [Gadon] and his counsel that the committee's job is to determine probable cause. What is happening is that the committee is the one working for him to build the evidence he needs,\" Belmonte said in Filipino and English. READ: Sereno hints of Duterte hand in her impeachment Detained Sen. Leila de Lima agreed with Sereno over her decision not to appear before the committee, saying that its members, whose integrity is suspect, should not be probing a woman of unquestionable probity and courage. \"Because the Sereno impeachment is a political operation of these Duterte lackeys, their judgment on the Chief Justice is a foregone conclusion.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Senators slammed the Department of Justice for clearing ex-Customs chief Nicanor Faeldon of drug charges over the P6.4-billion shabu shipment that slipped through the Bureau of Customs. On Wednesday, the DOJ released a copy of the charge sheet where several traders and Customs broker Mark Taguba were indicted on drug trading raps. Faeldon's name, however, was missing from the charge sheet. The Senate likewise conducted an extensive hearings on the issue that went on for nine sessions.  A copy of the resolution has yet to be released to the media. But the DOJ said in a statement that the complainant, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, \"failed to state with clarity the acts or omission supposedly committed\" by Faeldon. READ: DOJ summons Faeldon over P6.4-B smuggled shabu Sen. Francis \"Kiko\" Pangilinan, in his official Twitter account, challenged the primary campaign of the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte that vowed to ruthlessly rid the country of drugs. Pangilinan said: \"I thought this administration hate drugs. Ordinary citizens with small amount of drugs get killed. When we're talking about tons of shabu, you let them pass. This drug war is fake.\" \"This is a farce! When you're friends, you let them pass. When you view them as your critics, you push them to the wall. These people must have a pull on the government,\" Pangilinan said in Filipino. Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, for his part, echoed Pangilinan's contention of a favor seemingly given to those who are \"allies\" of Duterte. \"The question now is, who is responsible for the entry of the P6.4 billion shabu? The Customs security guard? Mr. Duterte, you are fooling the nation,\" Trillanes added. READ: DOJ wraps up probe on P6.4B smuggled shabu case Sen. Panfilo Lacson, chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs, noted that shipment would not have entered the country \"without the participation and complicity\" of BOC staff. \"Simple logic will tell us that, at the very least, those under whose watch the drug shipment passed through should be held criminally liable as well,\" Lacson, among those who led the Senate inquiry, said. Sen. Bam Aquino, meanwhile, called out the \"peculiar\" resolution issued by the DOJ. He recalled that during the Senate hearings, it was stressed that drugs cannot just slipped through the country without help from inside the BOC. \"Where it entered the country because they are conniving, or because of they were blinded by money, whatever the case, they should be liable for the shabu shipment,\" Aquino said. The senator stressed that the draft report of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, headed by Sen. Richard Gordon, recommended that cases should be filed against Customs officials, led by former commissioner Nicanor Faeldon. The case stemmed from the raid led by the operatives of the BOC, PDEA and the National Bureau of Investigation at a warehouse in Valenzuela City. Seized in the operation are 604 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. The shipment was declared as kitchenware, footwear and moldings, as it slipped through the BOC. The DOJ said in a statement that, following its earlier department order, the dismissal of complaints against Faeldon and several others \"shall be subject to automatic review by the Secretary of Justice.\"",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno's spokesperson clarified Thursday that speaking at public forums is part of her job as head of the judiciary. This was in response to criticism by Larry Gadon, her accuser in an impeachment complaint at the House of Representatives, on her public appearances.  \"Why is CJ Sereno skipping House hearings when she has all the time doing rounds in public forums? Sereno claims she wants to focus on her duties, but she's everywhere else discussing her case in media interviews,\" the lawyer said. Sereno has rarely given media interviews since being appointed chief justice in 2012. Sereno was invited as a keynote speaker at the Integrated Bar of the Philippines' Pagtugom sa Hamon forum, where progressive law organizations gathered to come up with legal remedies amid what she called an \"increasingly glaring atmosphere of impunity.\" In her speech, which ran almost 20 minutes, Sereno focused on the need for civil society and the members of the bar to collaborate in rousing government agencies to uphold human rights. She made no mention of the impeachment proceedings against her, nor did she grant an interview with reporters after. In the afternoon, Sereno also graced the event of the Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Pasay City. \"Conducting media interviews and attending public forums, inasmuch as they would make an informed citizenry and promote the respect for the rule of law, are also duties of the Chief Justice,\" Deinla said. \"Would the complainant further want to muzzle the Chief Justice in these public places?\" The lawyer also stressed that Sereno, in fact, did not \"skip\" the hearing at the House of Representatives on Wednesday, as the chief justice sent a team of lawyers to represesnt her. \"They have no interest in passively watching and listening to the proceedings while their client's right to due process is being curtailed. Their polite departure from the hall was warranted,\" Deinla added. The House panel voted to reject Sereno's appeal to have her lawyers cross-examine Gadon in the resumption of their deliberation on the impeachment complaint. After the voting, they manifested, through Rep. Kit Belmonte (6th District, Quezon City) that they would like to leave the hall. They were granted leave by Rep. Reynaldo Umali (Oriental Mindoro), who heads House Committee on Justice. \"By insisting on the Chief Justice's personal appearance at the hearings, the complainant is not only calling for the violation of her constitutional right to counsel, he is moreover forgetting that she is not responsible for proving her innocence.\" \"The onus to prove the allegations still lies on complainant,\" Deinla stressed. During the examination conducted by the members of the House panel, Gadon was quizzed on his sources for his allegations. The complainant, who is a vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte, scrambled to name his sources. He initially floated the name of Associate Justice Teresita De Castro among his witnesses. But he later added that he has not met De Castro. Instead, he said, senior justice beat reporter Jomar Canlas acted as their intermediary. De Castro, however, swiftly denied providing Canlas any documents or information. READ: Sereno challenges De Castro: Choose your legacy The House panel said that it will subpoena Canlas for the next hearing, while the rest of the justices will be invited to the hearing to shed light on Gadon's allegations. Gadon accused Sereno of corruption, committing high crimes, violating the Constitution and betraying the public trust. Among the grounds that he used are alleged falsified temporary restraining order issued by Sereno, and an internal memorandum signed by De Castro flagging the chief justice's several administration orders. Members of the House would vote in plenary on whether to approve or reject the justice committee's report on December 13. If at least a third of the members of the House—98 of 292 members—vote to approve the committee report, this will then constitute the Articles of Impeachment. The Articles of Impeachment will be transmitted to the Senate, which will try the case as an impeachment court.",

The Transport chief said he was also surprised by Chavez’s move. “He has my full trust and confidence. We have been doing plans and strategies together, up and until yesterday. Even by texts as I was on sickbay,” Tugade said. Chavez announced Thursday morning that he has tendered his irrevocable and immdeiate resignation over the sorry condition of the Metro Rail Transit Line 3. His resignation comes after a coach detached from a train last week and an accident that severed the arm of a passenger who fell onto the tracks.  In a letter to President Rodrigo Duterte, Chavez said that he resigned out of his sense of delicadeza, which roughly translates to propriety. Chavez also clarified that his move to step down was a personal decision. But Sen. Grace Poe expressed doubts that Chavez’s sense of delicadeza was the only reason that prompted him to resign. \"He seemed to be one of the DOTr officials who was determined to fully address all the issues plaguing the MRT,\" she said in a statement to media. \"I recall he was instrumental in unearthing the persons involved in anomalies that caused these issues.\"  READ: Undersecretary for Railways resigns over MRT woes The undersecretary's resignation was met with disappointment and with surprise. In a statement, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan said the group was shocked over the sudden resignation, saying Chavez “has been consistent in exposing the anomalies in various MRT contracts.” Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate (Bayan Muna party-list) described Chavez’s move as “unfortunate.” “Undersecretary Chavez is one of the more open public officials under the DOTr and often invites groups and people’s organizations to check or consult on how to deal with the rail problems in the country, he said. Zarate said the public should expect an even worse MRT service after the exit of Chavez. Poe, chair of committee on public services, noted that his departure calls for the evaluation of the actions and leadership of DOTr. “These issues should be properly and expeditiously resolved despite Undesecretary Chavez's resignation and especially considering the commuting horrors our people have to go through everyday,” Poe said. Sen. Nancy Binay, on the other hand, thanked Chavez for his service and his commitment to find solutions to the issues besetting Metro Manila’s busiest train line. “We wish him well and may he continue to be an advocate for a safe, efficient, and affordable transportation service,” Binay said. Rep. Teddy Baguilat (Ifugao) lauded Chavez’s action, saying “it sends a message of personal accountability for one’s actions.” “This is in stark contrast to his other colleagues’ penchant of continuing to blame the officials of the previous administration for the MRT woes. Filing inappropriate plunder cases doesn’t make the trains run better. Better management and purchase of newer ones do,” he said.  DOTr on Tuesday filed plunder charges against Cabinet members of the previous administration including former Transportation chief Joseph Emilio Abaya over the allegedly anomalous maintenance deal for MRT 3.

Callamard's supposed official visit to the country this year was canceled due to Duterte's demands of holding a public debate, which would break UN protocol.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos should expect more bloodshed. Human Rights Watch Asia Deputy Director Phelim Kine stressed this point Wednesday following President Rodrigo Duterte’s statement that he will bring back the Philippine National Police on the forefront of his brutal war on drugs. “The Duterte government’s apparent desire to resume the murderous drug war underscores the need for a United Nations-led international investigation into the killings. Until that happens, the number of victims denied justice and accountability will likely only continue to grow,” Kine said in a press release. He noted that the resumption of police anti-drug operations was “not wholly unexpected.” Kine said that Duterte might have been emboldened by the unwillingness of US President Donald Trump or fellow Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders to criticize the drug war during the 31st ASEAN Summit. ASEAN emphasizes non-interference in the domestic issues of its members. READ: Duterte says he will return drug war lead role to PNP During his speech at Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija Wednesday, the chief executive said he has no choice but to return the task of leading the drug war to the PNP. “But as of now, just to parry, I placed it under PDEA (Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency). But whether I like it or not, I have to return that power to the police because, surely, it will increase the activity of the shabu,” Duterte said. He said that PDEA might not be able to solve the country’s drug problem because it lacks manpower. The agency only has 2,000 personnel nationwide. Last October, Duterte designated PDEA as the “sole agency” in charge of the war on drugs following the public outrage over alleged police abuse. Early this year, the firebrand leader was forced to suspend Oplan Tokhang after the kidnapping and killing of South Korean businessman Jee Ick-joo in the hands of some cops. At that time, Duterte stripped the PNP and the National Bureau of Investigation of authority to conduct anti-illegal drug operations and transferred the campaign to PDEA backed by the Army. But he later on decided to tap the police again in the anti-narcotics campaign, citing lack of manpower. Duterte’s war on drugs, which has claimed over 12,000 lives according to rights watchdog, has received strong criticisms at home and abroad. The government has disputed these numbers. According to the latest #RealNumbersPH data release, there have been 3,967 drug suspects killed in government operations since July 2016. Government officials, including Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, said all of those killed were drug pushers. The data releases no longer include information on \"deaths under investigation,\" a tally of murders and homicides that police have yet to determine motives for.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines (First published on Nov. 23) — On November 20, the 72nd session of the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the resolution on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. The resolution reaffirms the universal declaration of human rights and takes note of the UN Plan of Action on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. \"Bearing in mind that impunity for attacks against journalists remains one of the greatest challenges to the safety of journalists and that ensuring accountability for crimes committed against journalists is a key element in preventing future attacks,\" the resolution read. The resolution also expressed concern over human rights violations and abuses linked to the safety of journalists and media workers, including killing, torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and arbitrary detention, expulsion, intimidation, harassment, threats and other forms of violence. The following countries co-sponsored the revised draft resolution:  In a Twitter post, British human rights organization Article 19 listed the co-sponsors of the UN resolution, noting which governments supported the resolution. The Philippines was not included in the co-sponsors list of the resolution on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. The Department of Foreign Affairs, however, explained that the list does not necessarily equate to the countries who voted in favor of the resolution. The resolution was adopted by consensus meaning it was not put to a vote. \"But if it were put to a vote, the Philippines would have voted to support the resolution, consistent with respect for human rights principles and media freedom,\" DFA spokesperson Robespierre Bolivar said. He added that the Philippines have supported similar draft resolutions in the past. RELATED: Unesco chief calls for justice for slain journalists",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Eight years after the murder of 58 people in what is known as the Maguindanao massacre, not one of the 197 accused has been convicted. In a case update released yesterday, the Supreme Court (SC) said 103 of the accused are still undergoing trial before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 221. The SC public information office said the charges against the accused led by former mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. are now in three final stages – resolution of remaining FOEs (formal offer of evidence) of the evidence-in-chief, demurrers to evidence and termination of the presentation of defense evidence.  “As soon as the accused have rested their presentation of evidence, their cases may be submitted for the decision of the court,” the SC said. “It’s the turn of the accused to present their evidence-in-chief. Thirty-one have concluded the presentation of their evidence and 34 more are currently presenting theirs,” it added. As of Nov. 21, the RTC has heard 273 witnesses – 166 from prosecution and 107 defense. The court has resolved all the 15 sets of formal offer of evidence in connection with the bail applications of 70 accused. It has likewise resolved all bail applications of the accused, including that of accused Ampatuan Jr., which was denied last May. The SC said the RTC might render judgment separately on each accused and not wait for all of them to conclude the presentation of their evidence. The motion for reconsideration filed by Ampatuan Jr. was denied on June 16, the SC said. “The prosecution has finished presenting evidence in the main cases against all of the accused, save for Andal Ampatuan Jr. Considering that the bail proceedings against him have been terminated, the court is now waiting for the manifestation to be filed by the prosecution with respect to their formal offer of evidence insofar as accused Ampatuan Jr. is concerned,” it added. Four of the accused, including Andal Ampatuan Sr., died while in detention and four more, who submitted their demurrer to evidence, were acquitted by the trial court. The murder cases involve 58 victims including 32 journalists, and 197 respondents including 15 who are surnamed Ampatuan. Of the 197 suspects, 115 have been arrested, the latest of whom was Jonathan Engid, nabbed in February. The proceedings are partipated in by 10 lawyers that comprise the third panel of  public prosecutors, eight private prosecutors and 23 defense lawyers or law firms. Meanwhile, lawyer Nena Santos, counsel for Maguindanao Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu, expressed confidence that justice would be served next year. Mangudadatu’s wife and sister were among those killed. “We are confident the cases will be wrapped up in 2018 and the decision handed down by the court,” Santos said. –  With Janvic Mateo",

            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales remained unfazed amid the impending impeachment complaint to be filed against her by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC). In a chance interview with reporters after delivering a speech at a university in Manila yesterday, Morales declined to comment on reports that the VACC will be filing the impeachment complaint against her before the House of Representatives within the week.  “Everybody is at liberty to file any complaint against anybody, including me,” Morales said. Dante Jimenez, founding chairman of VACC, is a supporter of President Duterte. The Office of the Ombudsman is investigating Duterte and his family’s bank accounts containing allegedly unexplained wealth.  Ferdinand Topacio, legal counsel of the VACC, earlier told reporters that they will be filing the complaint against Morales this week. He said the charges against Morales will revolve around her office’s supposed “inordinate delays” in conducting investigation on several complaints. The VACC claimed this inordinate delay resulted in the dismissal of several high-profile cases before the Sandiganbayan. Topacio said their impeachment complaint would also cover Morales’ alleged partiality in her office’s investigation on the 2015 Mamasapano incident, in which more than 60 people including 44 troopers from the Philippine National Police (PNP) were killed. Topacio claimed Morales rushed the filing of graft and usurpation cases against former president Benigno Aquino III before the Sandiganbayan in order to shield him from graver charges of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide. “No comment, I go by the evidence,” Morales said when asked on Topacio’s allegation. Morales also refused to comment on the status of her office’s investigation on the unexplained wealth of Duterte and his family. “I have inhibited myself there and I wouldn’t know its status,” she said. Morales received a backlash from Duterte and his allies after Overall Deputy Ombudsman Melchor Arthur Carandang bared that he was authorized by Morales to probe Duterte’s bank transactions when the latter was mayor of Davao City. Carandang also said his office obtained the bank documents from the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) showing that Duterte and his family have over P1 billion worth of transactions in several banks from 2006 to 2016. After Carandang’s statement hit the headlines, the AMLC denied providing any bank records to the ombudsman. The AMLC also said it has yet to evaluate if there is ground to initiate an investigation on Duterte’s bank transactions. This led Duterte to dare Morales to resign from her post for supposedly using illegally obtained documents in her office’s investigation. “I note it,” Morales said when asked about Duterte’s call for her to resign. Meanwhile, Morales said she remains confident on the strength of the cases they filed against several lawmakers in connection with the multibillion-peso pork barrel fund scam. “We are confident. We have never been more confident about the evidence that we have,” she said.  Morales made the statement after the Sandiganbayan last week affirmed its Sept. 15 ruling allowing former senator Jinggoy Estrada to post bail for his plunder case in connection with the pork scam. The Sandiganbayan maintained that the ombudsman’s prosecution team failed to present any evidence showing that Estrada is the mastermind or “main plunderer” in the case. “We go to court with our evidence. We find probable cause. It’s the Sandiganbayan which has its own assessment of evidence, we can’t control them. We only see to it that our evidence is highlighted,” Morales said. Morales said “the panel of investigators and prosecutors are still meeting” on whether to challenge the Sandiganbayan’s decision on Estrada’s bail before the Supreme Court. Aside from Estrada, also facing cases in connection with the alleged misuse of their Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) or pork barrel are former senators Ramon Revilla Jr. and Juan Ponce Enrile as well as several former and incumbent congressmen, together with the alleged scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Commission on Human Rights (CHR) chairman Chito Gascon said the threats of President Duterte against him are just part of the job. “Walang personalan, trabaho lang (nothing personal, just part of the job),” Gascon said yesterday in reaction to Duterte’s homophobic slur and threat to physically harm him for supposedly failing to speak out against illegal drugs. “Now that the President is coming close to 18 months in power, perhaps we have all become accustomed to his fighting or even sometimes his hurtful words. These are often the times when his supporters and defenders say that we should perhaps not take him too seriously or that he is engaged in hyperbole because he is an intellectual and/or a great leader,” Gascon said. “In this specific instance, I do not know if he means what he says or not,” he added. Speaking before the general assembly of the League of Cities of the Philippines on Tuesday, Duterte lashed out at Gascon over allegations of human rights violations in connection with the war against illegal drugs. “Human rights. P*** bakit ka tahimik diyan (why are you silent)? Kaya itong si (this) Gascon… pag nakita kita… (if I see you). Better avoid that we cross paths,” the President said, also warning the human rights chief of a slap in face.  “Hindi ko alam kung bakla ka o either masipa kita o... Hindi mo naman ako mademanda (I don’t know if you’re a homosexual or I will kick you and you can’t file charges against me),” Duterte added. Gascon cautioned Duterte against issuing such remarks, noting that his statements have the impact of policy and could incite followers to follow through with the threats. “Words matter whether spoken in public or in private. This is particularly important to remember when words are spoken by those who are supposed to be our leaders,” Gascon said. “What they say would indicate policy, could incite followers to a particular action and, worse, inform our children about what could be viewed as acceptable language or behavior,” he added. Gascon urged the Duterte administration to elevate the discourse and respect the mandate of independent bodies such as the CHR. “In particular, the CHR continues to expect that the government would cooperate with and accede to its requests in the performance of its functions, whatever the President’s personal attitude to it might be,” he said. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque has been named presidential adviser on human rights as the Duterte administration faces accusations of extrajudicial killings.

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), which is now leading the anti-drug war, lacks the manpower to do the job.   “With regard to drugs, I really do not know if the campaign worsened or improved,” the President said during a recent visit to wounded soldiers at the Army General Hospital in Taguig.   “But if I think that it worsened because PDEA lacks personnel – they have 2,000 for the entire nation – I will bring back (the drug war) to the police,” he said.  Duterte transferred the lead role in the crackdown on illegal drugs to PDEA following public outcry over the death of two teenage suspects at the hands of Caloocan policemen last August.  The policemen claimed that Kian delos Santos, 17, was a drug runner who violently resisted arrest but witnesses said the teenager was executed.  Carl Arnaiz, 19, was reportedly shot after robbing taxi driver Tomas Bagcal, who later disowned the affidavits attributed to him.  PDEA data showed that 117,268 drug personalities were arrested and 78,619 anti-drug operations were conducted from July to November this year.  A total of 2,525.77 kilos of shabu or methamphetamine worth P18.9 billion were seized in the same period. The agency has also declared 4,295 barangays drug-cleared since July.  House minority leader and Quezon Rep. Danilo Suarez supported yesterday the proposed return of the administration’s anti-drug war to the Philippine National Police (PNP). “It is the PNP that has more resources and personnel than the PDEA to confront drug syndicates,” he told a news conference. “I believe that the PDEA is doing its best to eradicate illegal drugs. However, if the problem worsens and the President decides to tap the PNP again, I will support that,” Suarez said. He said the illegal drug trade “is a P700-billion industry whose resources cannot be matched even by the PNP.” “The President has admitted that he underestimated the severity of the drug problem in the country. We are far from completely eradicating illegal drugs 16 months into the campaign,” he said. Suarez, an ally of former president and Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, blamed the Aquino administration for the growth of the illegal drug trade. “In 2012, the UN released a world drug report, wherein the Philippines recorded the highest rate of shabu use in East Asia. The Aquino administration seemed to have neglected this report as the drug problem worsened during its six-year term,” he said. He said the illegal drug trade would not have flourished “if not for the cooperation with drug syndicates of the police and local officials.” “I challenge the President to go after the big drug syndicates, players and protectors of illegal drugs, particularly those in the PNP and in local government units,” he said. He pointed out that drug-related crimes like rape and homicide “continue to proliferate.” “In recent news, a 23-year-old bank employee was raped and killed in Pasig City. A couple working as fast food chain employees were found floating in the waters off the coast of Orion and Pilar in Bataan. Even in my province, a teenage salesperson at a boutique got stabbed in the body and face, including in the eyes,” he said. He said the administration needs to reenergize its anti-drug campaign. -With Jess Diaz",

            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "DAVAO CITY, Philippines  —   The government will no longer hold peace talks with the communist rebels on orders of President Duterte, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza announced yesterday. “We are hereby announcing today the cancellation of all planned meetings with the CPP-NPA-NDF in line with President Duterte’s directive that there will be no more peace talks with them,” Dureza said, referring to the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front. Dureza said the President cited the continuing attacks by NPA rebels on government forces. In a speech Tuesday night, Duterte criticized the NPA for carrying out deadly attacks against soldiers and police and threatened to categorize them as a “terrorist”group. “I have decided to cut talks with the NPA,” he said. Duterte said the communists have launched attacks that harmed innocent civilians and made demands that he could not grant.  Duterte said he is prepared to go to war with the communists, who have been waging an armed struggle against the government for 50 years.  “If they want war, I will give it to them. I cannot do anything because I tried to talk to them and asked them if we can reach a settlement,” the President said.  “If you behave like that and we will go to war – even the civilians are being dragged into this – then we should just stop talking,” he added.  Dureza said he had informed the Norwegian government of Duterte’s decision. Norway is facilitating the peace talks between the Philippine government and the NDF, the umbrella organization representing the CPP-NPA in the negotiations. “This is an unfortunate development in our work for peace. Never before have we all reached this far in our negotiations with them,” Dureza said in his statement. “We have expressed our deep gratitude to the Royal Norwegian government for its strong support as we also expressed to their officials our regrets for this turn of events,” he said. Dureza said recent tragic and violent incidents all over the country committed by the communist rebels left the President with no choice but to arrive at this decision.  He said the termination of peace talks would mean no negotiations until “a change in the government’s position becomes evident.” The rebels have yet to comment on Duterte’s announcement but the CPP alleged this week that he was out to “perpetuate himself in power through one-man rule.” Dureza said he is still hoping that Duterte’s termination of the peace talks with the communist rebels is “only temporary.” “Despite this setback (hopefully only temporary), we remain steadfast and undeterred in our unrelenting journey for sustainable and just peace,” he said.  Benguet Rep. Ronald Cosalan said the peace negotiations remain government’s best option to end the five-decade old Maoist-inspired insurgency in the country. “The government must still leave the door open for possible future peace talks,” he said. Cosalan said the peace talks with the CPP-NPA could be done even on a regional level. Ifugao Rep. Teodoro Baguilat Jr. said backchannel talks should be made to resuscitate the talks even by region. Baguilat, however, blamed the rebels for lack of good faith and goodwill with their continuing attacks on government forces and imposition of revolutionary taxes in the countryside. Sen. Gregorio Honasan believes the country can withstand the expected surge in rebel attacks with the negotiations now stopped as long as the government does not give up its “high moral and political ground in the pursuit of lasting peace.” Sen. Ralph Recto said he respected Duterte’s decision with the rising number of police and military casualties from rebel attacks but urged him to “be a little more patient and do backchannel talks.” Sen. Francis Escudero expressed hope the cancellation of the talks was “just a snag in the peace talks and will serve to enlighten both sides.” He said the NPA should stop their attacks and be more flexible in their negotiation positions in order to pave the way for peace.  “In the meantime, I hope the door for peace will remain open, if not at the national level, perhaps in the near future or even at the local level whenever and wherever applicable,” Escudero said. With the collapse of the peace talks with the communist rebels, Duterte said there will be no more of the traditional Christmas truce with the NPA. “Wala na (No more). It’s an off and on thing which is really something of – it has become an endurance contest,” Duterte told reporters on Tuesday when asked if he would declare a ceasefire with the NPA next month.  The government declares a ceasefire with communists every December to allow them to visit their families during the holidays. The ceasefire bars government troops from launching offensives against the NPA but does not prevent them from defending themselves from attacks.  Last year, Duterte suspended offensive military operations against the NPA from Dec. 23 to 27 and from Dec. 31 to Jan. 3 the following year.  The military, for its part, declared its full support for Duterte’s decision to scuttle the peace talks with the communist rebels. “We support the President’s decision to cancel talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF and will continue to safeguard our communities against attacks by the NPA,” Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero said. “We ask the public for their continued support to the AFP’s peace and development efforts,” he added. AFP spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said the military fully supports such move considering how the NPA has failed to show sincerity in pursuing peace. Padilla said the government has done its part and negotiated with sincerity yet the rebels responded with treachery. Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesman Chief Supt. Dionardo Carlos said the police would follow Duterte’s order and continue the battle with the rebels. He said the PNP will continue its normal combat patrol and anti-insurgency operations in support of the AFP to maintain peace and order. The Department of National Defense (DND) said the AFP will now be on the offensive against the NPA. “The President has had enough of the communist movement’s penchant for double-talk and continued acts of atrocities against the Filipino people. In keeping with the President’s guidance, the defense department and Armed Forces of the Philippines will continue to vigorously pursue operations against their armed components,” defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said. Another contentious issue was the demand of the communists to free rebel leaders facing criminal charges. The government rejected this, saying it cannot be done until a bilateral ceasefire agreement is signed. The communist insurgency that began in 1968 and which the military said is now mostly waged in Mindanao has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. The rebels have been in off-and-on peace talks with the government since Duterte was elected last year. Both sides declared unilateral ceasefires, but these did not last. Duterte suspended formal peace talks in May after both sides failed to resolve a dispute over the CPP order for the NPA to step up attacks.  – Roel Pareño, Jose Rodel Clapano, Jaime Laude, Michael Punongbayan, Paolo Romero, Alexis Romero, Artemio Dumlao, AFP",

            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Justice (DOJ) has cleared former commissioner Nicanor Faeldon and other former officials of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in the drug and criminal charges filed against them by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) over the smuggling of a P6.4-billion shabu shipment last May. In a resolution released yesterday, the DOJ panel of prosecutors dismissed PDEA’s complaint for conspiracy to import illegal drugs and protecting or coddling of drug traffickers under Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act), negligence and tolerance under Article 208 of the Revised Penal Code and corrupt practices of public officers under Section 3 of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for lack of probable cause. The DOJ cited as basis in clearing Faeldon the PDEA’s “failure to state with clarity the acts or omission supposedly committed by the above-named BOC respondents that would constitute violation of the offense charged.” “Further, the evidence adduced by the PDEA in support of the charges were insufficient to establish probable case. Thus, the Panel is constrained to take into consideration the defense raised by the respondents,” the resolution of the panel chaired by Assistant State Prosecutor Aristotle Reyes read. Apart from Faeldon, also cleared were former Customs Investigation and Intelligence Service chief Neil Anthony Estrella; former director Milo Maestrecampo; intelligence officers Joel Pinawin and Oliver Valiente; Manila International Container Port district collector lawyer Vincent Phillip Maronilla; Faeldon’s fiancé, lawyer Jeline Maree Magsuci and BOC employees Alexandra Ventura, Randolph Cabansag, Dennis Maniego, Dennis Cabildo and John Edillor. The panel also dismissed the charges against Emily Anoche Dee for maintaining a drug den, citing lack of knowledge on the part of Emily that her property being rented would be used as a transshipment point of the subject drugs. They also cleared the corporate officers of Hong Fei Logistics due to failure of the PDEA to show that these corporate officers knowingly consented to or actively participated in the importation of the subject shipment. But while the DOJ cleared Faeldon and company, it found probable cause to indict the importers, brokers and other individuals involved in the shipment. The panel recommended no bail in the drug importation case filed before the Valenzuela regional trial court for violation of Section  4, in relation to Section 26 (a) of Republic Act No. 9165. Those indicted were Chen Ju Long alias Richard Tan or Richard Chen, Li Guang Feng alias Manny Li, Dong Yi Shen Xi alias Kenneth Dong, Mark Ruben Taguba II, Eirene Mae Tatad, Teejay Marcellana, Chen Min, Jhu Ming Jhun and Chen Rong Huan. “In finding probable cause against the above-named respondents for the importation of 602 kilograms of shabu, the Panel determined that the combination of the individual participation of each of the respondents, either as shipper, consolidator, facilitator, broker, financier, consignee or warehouse lessee – reveals a pattern of overt acts indicative of conspiracy to import into the country the dangerous drugs,” the DOJ explained. Sen. Francis Pangilinan said DOJ’s decision to dismiss the drug raps against Faeldon and other Customs officials is “completely unacceptable and preposterous.”  “It is clear with this decision that the government is not serious in its campaign against illegal drugs. This is a sham drug war that kills the poor while turning a blind eye on the rich and political allies,” he said in Filipino. – With Marvin Sy",

            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The camp of Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno yesterday slammed the House of Representatives’ justice committee for violating her constitutional rights when it disallowed her lawyers to cross-examine the complainant Lorenzo Gadon and his witnesses in the impeachment complaint against her. In a statement, lawyers of the Supreme Court (SC) chief claimed that the decision of the House panel violated her constitutional right to counsel and due process of law. “The committee decision to prohibit the lawyers of the Chief Justice from (participating in) the hearing is tantamount to barring CJ Sereno herself and belies their claim of an open and democratic process that honors the right to a fair trial,” they said. “It is apparent that the pursuit of truth has been put aside in favor of biased political interest,” Sereno’s lawyers said. Lawyer Josa Deinla, one of the spokespersons for Sereno, argued that while the House has the “exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment” it can conduct the impeachment process only in accordance with the standards imposed in other provisions in the Constitution, including the fundamental rights of the respondent. “This is a sad day for justice in this country that the Chief Justice, who has fought steadfastly to uphold the Constitution and the rights of the citizens, has now been denied her own constitutional rights,” Deinla said. Deinla cited Rule 115 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the rights of the accused, including the right to counsel and cross-examination. “Under the Constitution, the right to be heard and be defended by counsel in all stages of a criminal proceeding is a very basic right of an individual, which not even the honorable committee, indeed Congress, can take away from a respondent in an impeachment proceeding,” she said. Despite the setback, Sereno’s lawyers said the Chief Justice remained optimistic that she would have her day in court and that they would instead focus on the trial in the Senate. “The Chief Justice is eager to defend herself consistent with her rights and looks forward to her trial before the Senate, where she is hopeful her rights will be fully respected,” she said. Deinla said the majority of the committee disregarded Sereno’s fundamental rights as a respondent in an impeachment proceeding. Sereno’s camp also cited the disclosure of Gadon in the hearing yesterday that his source of information for an SC Internal Memorandum is no other than Associate Justice Teresita de Castro, who allegedly relayed the information to Manila Times reporter Jomar Canlas. “If indeed true, this reveals that Justice De Castro clearly violated the Internal Rules of the SC. The Internal Rules of the SC prominently safeguards the confidentiality of its sessions and internal documents,” Deinla said. “Specifically, the SC sessions are executive in character, with only members of the SC present. The SC deliberations are confidential and shall not be disclosed to outside parties, except if authorized by the SC,” she said. De Castro, in a brief statement issued by the SC public information office, denied Gadon’s claim. “I have never released to Canlas any information, report or document regarding the work of the Court,” she said. With the permission of the committee, Sereno’s lawyers left yesterday’s hearing after the panel led by Mindoro Oriental Rep. Reynaldo Umali barred them from questioning Gadon and his witnesses. At the same time, they urged the House to expedite its “preliminary investigation” of the complaint filed by Gadon and send the case to the Senate, where they said they would have a better chance of getting justice for their client. The committee made the decision following a lengthy discussion, during which majority leader and Ilocos Norte Rep. Rodolfo Fariñas cited a SC ruling in a case involving then detained senator Jinggoy Estrada and the ombudsman. Fariñas said the tribunal ruled that Estrada did not have the right to confront witnesses in the ombudsman’s investigation of the plunder charges against him. “That will come during the trial of the case. The same is true here in the impeachment complaint against the Chief Justice,” he said. He said Sereno concurred in the ruling written by Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio. Umali said the committee was “not depriving the Chief Justice of the right to counsel and the right to cross-examine the complainant and witnesses.” “You can do that through any member of the committee and even the chairman. You can ask your questions through them,” he told Sereno’s lawyers. He said the counsels could attend the hearings but not participate in the deliberations directly. Sereno’s lead lawyer Alexander Poblador said they decided to leave the hearing “because we cannot meaningfully participate and we did not want to participate in the proceedings because it is contrary to the position of the Chief Justice that the cross-examination should be done by her counsel.” He said Umali or any member of his committee “cannot conduct the cross-examination on behalf of the Chief Justice because they are not her counsels.” He said they did not walk out because they asked for permission to leave and were allowed to do so. He said they would consider “all options,” including seeking remedies in the SC. “The decision to expedite would really be the committee’s, so we are hoping that they would in fact expedite the process. If they believe Gadon has evidence, if they believe the case is sufficient in form and in substance, and cites sufficient grounds, why not go to the Senate?” he said. Poblador said the justice committee hearings are apparently intended “to provide evidence, which Gadon doesn’t seem to have.”  He said he was looking forward to grilling Gadon and his alleged witnesses in a Senate trial, which he added would be “consistent with the rights of the Chief Justice.” The justice committee barred Sereno’s lawyers from questioning Gadon and his witnesses after prohibiting lawmakers who are not members of the panel from participating in its proceedings. Leftist lawmakers walked out of the hearing after the committee voted on the prohibition. Among non-members who wanted to participate in the deliberations was Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman, who said non-members were traditionally permitted to take part in proceedings of any House committee. He also said the Umali panel violated the Constitution when it deprived Sereno’s lawyers the right to question Gadon and his witnesses. “While apparently granting the Chief Justice the right to counsel, such right is derogated by disallowing her counsel to conduct the cross-examination on her behalf, which is corollary to the right to counsel,” he said.   “The alibi that the Chief Justice cannot delegate her right to cross-examine to her lawyers who do not know the facts is unavailing because (her lawyers) do not have to personally know the facts since they have been fully briefed by the Chief Justice of the relevant facts and circumstances,” he said.  Lagman warned the justice committee that its decision to bar Sereno’s lawyers and non-members from participating in its deliberations “may result in a flawed impeachment proceeding.”  –  Edu Punay, Jess Diaz",

            "title": "Mar on DOTr’s plunder case: Pathetic",
            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Former interior secretary Manuel Roxas II described as “pathetic” the plunder complaints filed by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) against him and several other former officials of the Aquino administration in relation to the allegedly anomalous maintenance contract for the Metro Rail Transit 3 (MRT-3). In a text message from abroad, Roxas said that he was informed about the complaint filed by the DOTr against him because of decisions made by the Government Procurement Policy Board where he used to be member. “In a word? Pathetic. Dahil walang mapakitang accomplishment sa mga ipinangako, nagimbento ng kasong walang laman, walang basehan sa katotohanan o sa batas para ipakitang may ginagawa sila (Because they have accomplished nothing from the promises they made, they are now inventing cases that have no weight, no basis in truth or in law just to show that they are doing something),” Roxas said. “This is laughable on its face. I haven’t received a copy of the complaint and will withhold further comment until I do,” he added. Sen. Francis Pangilinan, president of the Liberal Party whose members include Roxas and several respondents, denounced the plunder complaints filed by the DOTr as a coverup for the lack of accomplishments of the administration. Instead of doing something about the problems of the MRT-3 in the 16 months that they have been in office, Pangilinan said the DOTr has done nothing while the issues have gotten worse. “When change is promised, the line and the wait at the MRT should be shorter, not longer. And the primary consideration should be that commuters are safe, not having their arms cut off or the coaches decoupled,” Pangilinan said in a statement. “When the issue is shifted from the quiet, everyday suffering of commuters who only want to get to work or school or home, it is not simply disrespectful, it is deception,” he added. When the various controversies involving the Duterte administration and its allies are compared to the plunder complaints filed against the former officials of the Aquino administration, Pangilinan said that “there seems to be a cover-up.” Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales yesterday gave assurance that her office will prioritize the investigation on various complaints in connection with the alleged anomalous deals entered by the previous administration for maintenance of the MRT-3. In a chance interview with reporters in Manila, Morales said she wants the complaints resolved before she retires in July 2018. “Yes of course, we will immediately act on them. We cannot wait until July to act on the complaints. I’m supposed to retire next year, unless I get impeached and convicted,” Morales said. Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) started its ocular inspection of the MRT-3 depot upon the request of the DOTr. Agents of the NBI Special Action Unit said they were tasked to find out if sabotage was committed after several train coaches detached from the main train between the Buendia and Ayala stations in Makati City last week. DOTr officials said that the messma card, which records interventions on the train, was missing on the coach that detached. The former maintenance operator of the MRT-3 said the flawed design of the train as well as issues in the takeover of the DOTr is to blame for the recent glitches of the train. “The continuance of the other glitches is proving BURI’s position that these are caused mainly by design flaws in the train system and other system components, the bad condition of the rails and overloading,” Busan Universal Rail Inc. said in a statement. The DOTr first issued a notice to terminate BURI’s contract with MRT-3 on Oct. 17. BURI said the problems in the MRT operations showed the lack of preparedness of new DOTr officials to take over the maintenance operations.               “The rapid worsening of the MRT-3 following DOTr’s takeover, however, shows that the DOTr was not truly ready to assume BURI’s work, contrary to the breast-beating of Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez. “As to the decoupling incident, Chavez is desperately making excuses and finger-pointing, apparently to mislead the public away from the real issues,” BURI said. The maintenance provider explained that both the train coupler and messma machine (referred to as the train’s black box) that records train status and some driver reactions undergo four important procedures. It added that the DOTr is responsible for security at the depot.  President Duterte has rejected calls for him to fire Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade for his failure to solve the problems plaguing the MRT-3. Duterte said he remains confident that Tugade would be able to fix the issues hounding MRT-3.  “I will not do that. I have full trust and confidence in Tugade that he can correct the mistakes there, if there are, and fix it,” the President told reporters last Tuesday in Taguig.  “I would be resisting the call or if you want to put it in another, I will decline the request,” he added.  Opposition lawmakers Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano and Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao have asked Duterte to dismiss Tugade, saying the transportation chief has failed to address the glitches hounding the MRT.   Tugade, a classmate of Duterte at San Beda College of Law, has said only the President can ask him to step down from his post.  Asked if he has set a timeframe for Tugade to solve the problem, Duterte replied: “You know, problems, they come and go, they crop up every day.” – With Alexis Romero, Elizabeth Marcelo, Paolo Romero, Ghio ",

            "title": "SC justices to be invited to CJ impeach hearing",
            "timestamp": "November 23, 2017 - 12:00am",
            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — After failing to make Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno attend a hearing on her impeachment, a House panel decided yesterday to invite her magistrate-colleagues to shed light on issues raised against her by a private lawyer. The committee on justice, chaired by Oriental Mindoro Rep. Reynaldo Umali, agreed to summon the other magistrates of the Supreme Court (SC) upon motion of Dinagat Islands Rep. Kaka Bag-ao during yesterday’s hearing to determine if there is probable cause to impeach Sereno. The committee suspended the hearing last night and set the next hearings for Monday until Wednesday. Umali said his panel would hold at least six more hearings next week and early next month, and would vote on Dec. 11 on whether to send the impeachment case to the Senate for trial. “We expect the plenary to act on our report on Dec. 13 before we adjourn for our Christmas break,” he said. At the start of the hearing, the committee voted 30-3 to allow non-members and lawyers of Sereno to attend but not to participate in deliberations on her impeachment. “There is a motion duly seconded, there being no objection, the motion is carried... to invite all members of the SC,” Umali declared upon the motion of Bag-ao. Bag-ao had moved that all the magistrates be invited after the committee allowed a motion by complainant Lorenzo Gadon to invite SC Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro to the panel hearing. Gadon said De Castro could share insights on allegations that Sereno had tampered with a temporary restraining order on a party-list petition. “Since there is a proposal to invite an SC member, is it also possible that in the process of our proceedings, we’d have to invite other justices of the SC to also shed light on documents being presented? I think we should invite all the justices of the SC,” she said. “I guess so, to the extent that this will come out in the proceedings, so that it will be established that their testimonies would be relevant. We will invite everyone because this is what we need for purposes of prosecuting this case eventually, if at all,” Umali said. Gadon requested the Umali committee to invite De Castro so she could share her insights on reports Sereno had forged a TRO released sometime in mid-2013 by an SC division. “This incident can be best explained by Justice De Castro. I’m requesting that an invitation be sent,” Gadon told the panel. “I’m assured that she will come, and that she will issue the statements.”  Gadon, a lawyer, admitted getting the information from a March 2013 article in The Manila Times written by senior reporter Jomar Canlas. He said he has a photocopy of the draft TRO but that the clerk of court couldn’t give him an official copy yet. The complainant said the draft TRO was “substantially modified” by Sereno, in direct violation of the 1987 Constitution. Sereno’s alleged action, he said, was “culpable” violation of the Constitution as it was not sanctioned by the 15-man SC convened as a whole. Gadon also alleged that Sereno had repeatedly bypassed her colleagues and decided unilaterally on internal matters needing approval of the other SC justices. In his impeachment complaint, Gadon also accused Sereno of “falsifying and tampering” SC decisions, including a draft halt order and an administrative order on opening a Regional Constitutional Administrative Office in Central Visayas in 2012. Sereno “usurped the power of the SC” by issuing the orders allegedly without the knowledge of the whole court, added Gadon. House Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, also a lawyer by profession, warned against inviting all SC justices. “May I move that such invitation be extended as the need arises. Because if we were to truly... imagine that such an invitation would be extended to the entire SC. That already borders on ridicule and incredulity,” she argued. “Of course this will not be a one-of thing... we’ll try to manage this depending on the need of the hearings. This is not going to be a wholesale invitation to everyone because it will be difficult to manage,” Umali replied. “The SC may no longer be able to function if they’re all here.” When Quezon City Rep. Vincent Crisologo asked Umali what would happen if the SC magistrates snub the committee’s invitation, the latter said, ”We will cross the bridge when we get there.”  Earlier, his committee voted 30-3 yesterday to allow non-members and lawyers of Sereno to attend the impeachment hearings – but not to participate in its deliberations. The vote effectively muted the pro-Sereno positions taken by Reps. Edcel Lagman of Albay and Tom Villarin of party-list Akbayan – both LP allies – who were initially allowed to talk “out of liberality” adopted by the committee. House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas said the two should join either the super majority coalition or the House minority bloc (opposition) if they want to be allowed to participate. Being in an independent bloc, he said, doesn’t entitle them to membership in any committee, Fariñas pointed out. “It will defeat the very purpose of our committee membership (if we allow you to participate). You can attend, but you cannot speak ahead of the justice committee members,” he pointed out. “The Supreme Court said you (Lagman et al) are in the independent bloc and not in the minority bloc. As independent lawmakers, you are not members of the committee. You want to join? Then you either join the majority or the minority,” he advised them. The Umali committee likewise barred – through a 30-4 vote – defense lawyers from cross-examining the complainant and other possible witnesses in the impeachment hearing. The fourth congressman who voted to allow defense lawyers to cross-examine Gadon was Agusan del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun. Fariñas also defended the motion of Ako Bicol Rep. Alfredo Garbin Jr. to disallow cross-examination, explaining that committee hearings on impeachment complaints are like preliminary investigations where cross-examinations are not allowed. “We are not on trial yet. For all we know we might even dismiss this, and the plenary might reverse it. There is no cross-examination,” he said, citing a legal opinion of Sereno herself in the pork barrel case against former senator Jinggoy Estrada. In an SC ruling in March 2015, justices declared that Estrada, former Senate president Juan Ponce Enrile and detained former senator Bong Revilla should not be furnished copies of affidavits during the preliminary investigation stage. Fariñas also cited the case of the late chief justice Renato Corona who, he said, was deprived of his right to rebut allegations against him as 185 lawmakers in December 2011 signed and sent the impeachment complaint directly to the Senate for trial. Before last night’s suspension, Quezon City Rep. Jose Christopher Belmonte urged Gadon to come up with evidence to support his accusations against Sereno. “We are supposed to determine probable cause here, but the way the proceedings went, the committee is trying to find evidence to support your complaint. You should have the evidence,” he told Gadon. The complainant replied that he has attached documents to his complaint documents. Rep. Rodante Marcoleta of party-list group Social Amelioration and Genuine Intervention on Poverty questioned Gadon on his claim that Sereno “manipulated” the proceedings of the Judicial and Bar Council in the nomination of then solicitor general Francis Jardeleza for SC justice. “There are other members of the council, including a representative of Congress. Are you saying that the Chief Justice manipulated them?” Marcoleta asked. “No, your honor, what I am saying is that the Chief Justice manipulated the process,” Gadon replied. Gadon was also questioned on his allegation that Sereno failed to declare P37 million the government paid her for legal service in its case against Philippine International Air Terminals Inc., builder of the airport’s Terminal 3. Garcia said the Chief Justice, in her reply to the complaint, admitted receiving P30.3 million and paying more than P8 million in taxes. “It’s not P37 million, it’s P30.3 million,” she said. “P37 million was just my calculation because the payment the Chief Justice received was in dollars,” Gadon said. – Alexis Romero",

In the copy of information or charge sheet released to the members of the media, Faeldon's name was missing. Instead, the DOJ indicted the following over the P6.4 billion shabu shipment that slipped through the BOC: In a statement, the DOJ said that the panel of prosecutors led by Assistant Prosecutor Aristotle Reyes \"found probable cause for “importation of dangerous drugs” under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 9165 otherwise known as The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.\" READ: DOJ wraps up probe on P6.4B smuggled shabu case \"The [p]anel determined that the combination of the individual participation of each of the respondents, either as shipper, consolidator, facilitator, broker, financier, consignee, or warehouse lessee – reveals a pattern of over acts indicative of conspiracy to import into the country the dangerous drugs,\" the DOJ also said.

Charges against the following members of the NBI-Anti Organized Transnational Crime Division were also dismissed by the DOJ. The above mentioned respondents were said to have retained custody of the 500 kilograms of shabu they seized, examined and investigated. The panel held that \"under the circumstances attendant to the case, and pursuant to relevant Dangerous Drugs Board Regulations and jurisprudence,\" the act of the agents are justified. Meanwhile charges against Fidel Anoche Dee, the warehouse man, and his sister Emily Anoche Dee were also dropped. The DOJ noted however that following its earlier department order, the dismissal of complaints against Faeldon and several orders \"shall be subject to automatic review by the Secretary of Justice.\" The case stemmed from the raid led by the operatives of the BOC, PDEA, and the National Bureau of Investigation at a warehouse in Valenzuela City. Seized in the operation are 604 kilograms of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. The shipment was declared as kitchenware, footwear and moldings, as it slipped through the BOC. The Office of the Ombudsman, for its part, said on November 7 that it has \"created a panel to conduct a fact-finding investigation into alleged anomalies in the release of P6.4 billion worth of metamphetamine or 'shabu,' through the greenlane (sic) of Bureau of Customs.\" The announcement comes days after President Rodrigo Duterte said that he will leave the investigation of allegations that his son Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte and son-in-law Manases \"Mans\" Carpio are involved in the case to independent agencies.",

Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña and Uber Philippines general manager Laurence Cua launched the partnership, dubbed uberGOV, on Friday. With the program, the city government is expected to save on transportation expenses, help reduce carbon footprint and ease traffic in the city. It can also audit and review the trips the registered vehicles have taken, track their location and manage both the drivers and vehicles. More government vehicles may be added and other government units will be covered if the program delivers on its objectives. “The government does not have to procure, maintain and insure as many vehicles for the use of its employees. More government employees can enjoy the use of these government vehicles,“ Cua said. “With fewer and better utilized vehicles...traffic in the city could improve,” he added.  Uber has been operating in Cebu since December 2015.

            "content": "LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines — The repair of school buildings damaged by the conflict in Marawi City has started and more campuses are expected to reopen soon in areas now secured by authorities. John Magno, regional education secretary of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, said on Saturday their effort to restore the school buildings is supported by Marawi City Mayor Majul Gandamra and the local district engineering office. Classes in more than a dozen schools in Marawi City have resumed after President Rodrigo Duterte announced last month that state security forces have cleared all of its barangays from Maute and Abu Sayyaf gunmen. DepEd-ARMM is targeting the initial repair of at least seven schools near what became as “main battle area” during the five-month siege of Marawi City by terrorists. Magno’s deputy, Alfhadar Pajiji, announced in Marawi City Wednesday that DepEd-ARMM has earmarked P34 million for the initial rehabilitation of the seven school buildings. Pajiji, who is assistant regional education secretary, was in Marawi City Wednesday to inspect school campuses the military and police have just cleared from booby traps laid by terrorists. Magno said authorities have also approved the reopening of the Matampay, Tampilong, Datu Saber, Basak, Amai Pakpak and Pandi Elementary Schools. Magno, citing reports from the office of Zenaida Unte, DepEd-ARMM’s assistant schools superintendent in Marawi City, said also to be reopened is a local national high school, now guarded by authorities.  Magno said the five-month hostilities in Marawi City displaced no fewer than 60,000 elementary pupils and high school students. Thousands of the displaced school children are attending remedial classes in temporary learning sites located in safe areas. The children in the makeshift learning facilities are regularly supplied with nutritious meals by DepEd-ARMM, the World Food Programme and the Gawad Kalinga, a Philippine humanitarian outfit. Magno said 22 schools in the main battle area were badly damaged by the heavy gunfights between terrorists and government forces. “The executive department of ARMM is doing its best to address the problem. The national office of DepEd is also extending support towards that end,” Magno said. ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman announced last Monday that the regional government will allocate P930 million for rehabilitation projects in Marawi City. Hataman said the ARMM administration will also separately provide P250 million, from the coffers of different regional agencies, as initial seed fund for the reconstruction of Marawi City’s devastated socio-economic facilities. Gandamra, chairman of the Marawi City peace and order council, said thousands of residents have returned to more than a dozen barangays the military and police have declared safe. He said they are now working on the return of more evacuees to at least eight more barangays in the coming weeks. Among the first to resettle in their abandoned homes were displaced residents of Marawi City’s adjoining Barangays Basak Malutlut, Matampay, Panggao Saduc, Datu Saber, Tampilong, Luksadatu, East Basak and Barrio Green, scenes of deadly clashes between government troops and militants.   Gandamra, elected to office only last year, said on Saturday that he is thankful to the provincial government of Lanao del Sur and ARMM’s Humanitarian Emergency Assistance and Response Team for helping provide continuing relief interventions to the returning evacuees. The ARMM-HEART and personnel of the Lanao del Sur provincial government have established relief centers in cleared barangays to attend to the needs of residents who have returned from the evacuation centers.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Jesus Rico Sarmiento, the former mayor of Garchitorena town in Camarines Sur has admitted guilt to a criminal case over his use of luxury vehicles of a private contractor with which the municipality had transactions in 2014. In a decision promulgated on November 10, the Sandiganbayan Seventh Division noted the guilty plea entered by Sarmiento during his arraignment on Oct. 27, 2017 for his case of violation of Section 7 (d) of Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. “Accused was fully apprised of the consequences of his plea in open Court...he is deemed to have admitted all the accusations alleged in the [case] information,” the court said adding that Sarmiento was assisted by his lawyer Amador Simando Jr., during his arraignment. Section 7 (d) of RA 6713 prohibits public officials and employees from soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, “any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value from any person in the course of their official duties or in connection with any operation being regulated by, or any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their office.” Based on the information of the case filed by the Office of the Ombudsman early this year, Sarmiento, “in the course of his official duties” as mayor, publicly and repeatedly used two luxury vehicles owned by a certain Maria Carmela Fernando of JM Cofer Construction and Supply from January to October 2014.\" The ombudsman said JM Cofer Construction and Supply, at that time, has four ongoing projects with the municipal government, thus Sarmiento's act is considered unethical under RA 6713. Nonetheless, Sarmiento will not serve any jail term for the case. Instead, the Seventh Division only ordered him to pay a fine. “Having appreciated in his favor the mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty, accused is imposed the penalty of fine of two thousand pesos (P2,000.00),” the decision penned by division chairman Associate Justice Ma. Theresa Dolores Gomez-Estoesta read. Associate Justices Lorifel Pahimna and Bayani Jacinto concurred with the ruling. Under Section 11 of RA 6713, violation of Section 7 (d) of the same law is punishable with imprisonment not exceeding five years, or a fine not exceeding P5,000, or both, still subject to the discretion of the court of competent jurisdiction. The court may also order the accused's disqualification from holding public office. Sarmiento sought re-election in May 2016 but lost to Nelson Bueza.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Internal Affairs Service (IAS) of the Philippine National Police (PNP) has recommended the dismissal of 18 police officers from the Northern Police District for kidnapping. In separate resolutions dated Nov. 20, IAS found the policemen guilty of grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a police officer. IAS Inspector General Alfegar Triambulo said yesterday they are just waiting for PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa to approve their recommendations. In an interview, Triambulo said the 18 are among the 66 policemen they have recommended for dismissal this month. “Those are the cases we disposed for the month of November only,” Triambulo said a text message. Eleven of the policemen were assigned in Malabon City and are accused of kidnapping a woman last May 20 in Barangay Veterans Village. Senior Police Officers 2 Jerry dela Torre and Ricky Pelicano; Police Officers 3 Bernardino Pacoma, Michael Angelo Solomon and Luis Hizon Jr.; PO2s Michael Huerto and Wilson Sanchez; PO1s Frances Camua, Joselito Ereno, Ricky Lamsen and Jovito Roque Jr. also extorted P2 million in cash and a kilo of shabu from their victim, Norma Adrales, Triambulo said. Adrales had just visited her boyfriend, who is serving sentence for a drug offense at New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City, when she was kidnapped. In a five-page resolution, the IAS debunked the lawmen’s defense they were conducting an anti-narcotics operation against Adrales in Barangay Potrero, Malabon on May 22, or two days after the victim’s kidnapping. “The alleged anti-narcotics/test-buy operation is dented with irregularities right from the inception, notably, the participation of personnel who are not even members of Malabon City SDEU (station drug enforcement unit),” the resolution read. IAS also found out the policemen falsified documents such as medical certificates to hide their illegal activity and pilfered half a kilo of shabu for planting of evidence against other drug suspects. Seven police officers from Navotas City were also recommended for dismissal for the kidnapping and torture of a drug suspect on Aug. 11: PO3 Kenneth Loria; PO2s Jonnel Barocaboc and Jessrald Pacinio; PO1s Mark Ryan Mones, Christian Paul Bondoc, Emmanuel Benedict Alojacin and Jack Rennert Etcubanas. In a seven-page resolution, the investigating body said the policemen conspired in kidnapping Mark Echapare and demanded P2 million from the victim’s family in exchange for the dropping of criminal charges. Triambulo said around 300 police officers have been dismissed from the service for various offenses since he became the head of IAS last year.",

Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command chief, said personnel of the Naval Special Operations Group and Special Forces were patrolling the lakeside in Barangay Marinaut when they spotted several firearms on the surface of the water.  Galvez said an M60 machine gun, two grenade launchers, 13 rounds of rocket propelled grenades, 18 rifle grenades and machine gun bullets were recovered. Galvez lauded ground troops for their effort to locate the guns and ammunition the terrorists hid in Marawi. “Their mission is never easy especially that there is a possibility that these ammunition will explode…However, I am confident that our combat divers are seasoned and experienced for this task,” he said. Earlier this month, four machine guns and 26 rifles – 12 M14s,  four caliber .50s, two AK 47s, two carbines, three FALs, two M16s and an M79 – were found submerged also in Lake Lanao in front of the buildings that Maute militants had occupied before they fled the city. Brig. Gen. Roseller Murillo, Joint Task Force Ranao commander, said several guns have also been recovered from the main battle area. Government troops have continued clearing operations since Marawi was declared liberated from terrorists last month. The military said the recovered guns would be destroyed to ensure that they would not end up in the hands of the terrorists again.   President Duterte ordered the military to destroy all firearms recovered from the militants.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3) removed a train yesterday morning after a gap of two millimeters was found in a train’s coupler. The train operator did not allow commuters to board the train at the Taft Avenue station after he noticed that a rubber bushing was torn out from the coupler, a device that connects two train cars, said Ric Inotorio, MRT-3 director for operations. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the MRT-3 has removed the affected train from the tracks and brought it back to its depot in Quezon City to avoid the possibility of decoupling. Inotorio attributed the torn bushing to “wear and tear.”  Reacting to DOTr’s statement, Inotorio said there is no possibility that train cars would be detached because they are “tightly coupled” and the gap was immediately noticed by the train operator.   Some train cars were detached last week between the Ayala and Buendia stations in Makati City. The train’s messma card or black box, which records all interventions of the train’s system, went missing.  The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has taken over the investigation of the missing messma card and the reasons behind the decoupling of train cars, giving weight to claims of sabotage.  The decoupling forced Cesar Chavez, DOTr undersecretary for railways, to tender his irrevocable resignation. A lawmaker urged Chavez to fully disclose the reasons for his sudden resignation. “Something does not add up in his story that he quit because of delicadeza or propriety,” Quezon City Rep. Winston Castelo said. He said there seemed to be an unseen hand in Chavez’s resignation. “His resignation was not compatible with his earlier assurance to the public that he and DOTr Secretary Art Tugade were on top of the situation regarding the MRT-3 and that better service was expected in the next three to six months,”Castelo said. Meanwhile, Sen. Grace Poe expressed alarm over DOTr officials’ indecision and lack of teamwork. Chavez said the officials were too slow in making decisions and failed to give the necessary support to implement urgent reforms and programs to make the rail line efficient and safer.",

Former Zamboanga peninsula regional director Jesus Nieves should be charged with graft and malversation of public funds in connection with the transfer of money from the trust account of the regional office to a closed account, according to a resolution signed by Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales recently and released yesterday . Morales said regional chief accountant Marilou Tolosa should be included in the charge sheets. Investigation showed that in August 2007, Tolosa requested the closure of an account of the DepEd regional office with the Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), which was used for a special project funded by the Belgian government. With the closure of the account, the balance of P157.93 was transferred to the trust account of the DepEd regional office. However, investigation showed that on Nov. 29 of the same year, Nieves authorized PVB to debit a total of P6,164,424.23 from the trust account and transferred the amount to the closed account. Nieves and Tolosa also allegedly withdrew the money that was transferred to the supposedly closed account.

NPC commissioner said they have tapped the FTC and other privacy regulators worldwide to share information on the data breach involving over 57 million Uber users and drivers. FTC is an independent government agency tasked to ensure consumer protection in the US. It has started its own investigation on the data breach. On Thursday, NPC officials met with representatives of Uber Philippines to discuss the data breach. However, Liboro said Uber officials were not able to provide the commission with vital information, particularly if data of Filipino users were among those stolen. “We cannot rule out at that this time that any Filipino data was compromised,” said Liboro. The privacy commissioner said they gave Uber until today to provide vital information about the breach. “The NPC has reminded Uber that the concealment of a data breach that involves sensitive personal information or information that, under the circumstances, can be used to enable identity fraud, is a criminal offense punishable under the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” said Liboro. Uber chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi on Wednesday confirmed that a massive data breach happened last year and that it was concealed by its former chief security officer and one of his deputies. Khosrowshahi said the breach involved the personal data of 50 million users and seven million drivers worldwide.   ",

Roque said the President also instructed his aide Christopher  “Bong” Go to provide employment, scholarship and financial assistance to the families of the victims. Fifty-eight people, including 32 journalists, were killed in the massacre on Nov. 23, 2009.  The journalists were on their way to cover the filing of the certificate of candidacy of then Buluan vice mayor Esmael Mangudadatu when they were snatched by armed men and killed in Ampatuan town. Political rivalry was believed to be the motive for the killing because Mangudadatu was running against Andal Ampatuan Jr., the mayor of Datu Unsay at the time. Malacañang is confident the case will be resolved in four years. Meanwhile, the peace and order councils of Maguindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao said a reward should be offered for information leading to the arrest of the suspects in the massacre who remain at large, including the two grandsons of the alleged mastermind, former Maguindanao governor Andal Ampatuan Sr. Of the 188 accused, 106 are detained, two freed on bail, one released because of the writ of habeas corpus and three died while in jail.",

Senior Superintendent Ruel Berango, city police chief, said a task force was created to look into the case of Phillip Bacudo, 19, who went missing after he was allegedly arrested near a police station along Mabuhay road on Nov. 10. Initial reports showed Bacudo and his friends, all residents of Greenville Subdivision in Barangay Calumpang, went on a drinking spree at a beer joint near the Bulaong Terminal in Barangay North.  Bacudo and his friends were riding a tricycle on their way home at around 1 a.m. when they were blocked by a gunman who was wearing a bonnet. Witnesses said the tricycle driver sped off, but the gunman and a man wearing a police uniform who was driving a police car chased them.  The alleged policeman reportedly caught up with Bacudo when the tricycle ran out of fuel and handcuffed him. The  companions of the teenager managed to hide in the bushes and escaped. Bacudo was reportedly crying as the tricycle was tied to the police vehicle  and headed to  Police Station 4 in Barangay San Isidro. The tricycle was later found in the compound of the police station. When Bacudo’s parents Bernard and Susana reported the incident to the police, Chief Inspector Rexor Canoy and his deputy Senior Inspector Lemuel Enrijo denied that the teenager or any of his companions were brought to the police station. The police officers said they only recovered the tricycle after receiving a call that it was abandoned elsewhere. Bacudo’s parents said General Santos Mayor Ronnel Rivera has yet to act on their letter seeking assistance to   find their son.",

Claiming he wanted “to get the pulse of the ordinary riders” without special treatment, Roque was accompanied by security escorts and reporters throughout his trip. Roque described his experience as pleasant, speedy and “cold” despite the long lines at the station, as he apologized to any inconvenience his trip might have caused commuters.  The spokesperson said he will report back to President Duterte that improving the train systems is still the best solution to Metro Manila’s worsening traffic problems.  “It is clear to me that the solution is to improve the MRT-3 so more people will ride and not use their cars,” he said of the MRT-3, which sees 500,000 passengers every day. He added that it is imperative for the MRT-3 to increase the number of coaches and improve its service, similar to LRT-1, which he praised. The MRT-3 has been facing criticism lately due to frequent glitches as well as a recent “decoupling” incident wherein a coach was left behind by the main train in between stations.  Roque said he decided to try the trains during off-peak hours so as not to inconvenience more commuters, which he attributed to the media frenzy. He brushed aside criticisms that he was doing this as a public relations stunt and claimed that the government is just trying to get in touch with the plight of the commuters.  Roque rode the MRT-3 at the start of the line at the North Avenue and waited around 10 minutes in line before he was able to board the train. However, at the succeeding stations, lines for the first door of the last coach, where Roque was seated, were cleared and no passengers were allowed to board. Roque denied that lines were being cleared for him or that there was any special treatment. He said this would “defeat the purpose” of him experiencing what regular riders go through. After transferring to the LRT-1, passengers were again prohibited to board the train where Roque was seated at the succeeding stations. Even with the security detail and the off-peak visit, Roque said his experience was “realistic” but he said he can only imagine what the ordinary Filipino is going through during the cramped rush hour.",

Uber chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi on Wednesday confirmed to Bloomberg US that a massive data breach happened last year and that it was concealed by its former chief security officer and one of his deputies. Khosrowshahi said the breach involved the personal data of 50 million users and seven million drivers worldwide. “While we have not seen evidence of fraud or misuse tied to the incident, we are monitoring the affected accounts and have flagged them for additional fraud protection,” Khosrowshahi was quoted as saying. “None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,” he added. In a statement, the NPC said Uber must comply with Philippine data privacy and protection laws as it processes Filipino end user data. “To this end, we have summoned Uber to a meeting… to shed more light about the incident and to comply with the formal breach notification procedure as provided by the Data Privacy Act of 2012,” said the privacy body. “This includes providing the NPC with detailed information on the nature of the breach, the personal data of Filipinos possibly involved, and the measures taken by Uber to address the breach,” it added.",

Carpio said the cancellation of the peace talks between the national government and the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (NPA)-National Democratic Front would not affect ongoing peace talks with local leaders. The Davao City Peace Committee (DC-PEACE) headed by retired judge Ridgway Tanjili is leading peace negotiations with NPA leaders here. “The basis of the work of the DC-PEACE is the general welfare clause under the Local Government Code,” Carpio said. She said localized peace talks do not contradict with the position of the national government. “Our work and the work of the national government is not incompatible, especially now  that they will not pursue the peace talks,” Carpio said. She said she would only cancel localized peace talks with NPA rebels once Malacañang declares the rebel group as a terrorist organization. “There is no paper yet. Everything is just verbal. Legally, we can still continue to negotiate and talk if the NPA still wants to talk with our DC-PEACE,” Carpio said. Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza announced on Wednesday that the government would no longer hold peace talks with communist rebels as ordered by the President. Dureza said he had informed the Norwegian government, which is facilitating the peace talks, of Duterte’s decision. In a speech Tuesday night, Duterte criticized the NPA for its attacks on soldiers and police officers even as he threatened to categorize them as a terrorist group.

He said they are also targeting other barangay halls with the same violations.   “We have no other recourse but to charge them with obstruction if they continue to defy our orders,” Lim added. Barangay 643 chairman Edmund Gumogda said the MMDA’s decision to demolish their barangay offices will greatly affect security in the University Belt area. He said the closed-circuit television system installed in the barangay hall were also removed, which could affect their monitoring of criminals who are usually victimizing students in their areas.

Petitioners led by Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate filed a motion asking the SC to decide on their consolidated petitions seeking to enjoin the government from further implementing Department of Transportation and Communications (now Department of Transportation) Order 2014-04, which increased the MRT-3 fare by as much as P10 per ride. Apart from voiding the fare hike order and reverting to the previous base fare of P10 to P15, they also urged the SC to order an “across-the-board refund” to riders. “The worsening condition of our rail system in spite of the implementation of the fare hikes only proves the correctness and validity of petitioners grounds for their opposition to the 2015 LRT/MRT fare hikes, as embodied in the Department Order 2014-014 of then DOTC,” the motion read. “The MRT-3, despite the much-questioned and much-protested fare hike, continues to give its passengers poor and unsatisfactory service. It continues to experience technical problems that endanger the safety of the riding public. News about its malfunctions has now become so common, and complaints from the public have been increasing,” it further stressed. Petitioners cited recently reported incidents, including the disposable diaper left hanging on the MRT-3’s overhead catenary system, which stalled the operation for more than an hour; a coach detached from the train, which required the evacuation of around 130 to 140 passengers; and a woman who lost her right arm on Nov. 14 when it was caught in the MRT-3 train’s coupler. They also informed the SC about the termination of the P3.8-billion MRT-3 maintenance contract with Busan Universal Railway Inc.  due to the latter’s alleged inefficiency and the filing of plunder charges before the Office of the Ombudsman against some Cabinet members of former president Benigno Aquino III over the allegedly anomalous MRT-3 maintenance deal. Zarate was joined by the former Iloilo Rep. Augusto Syjuco and the United Filipino Consumers and Commuters Inc. in filing the petitions in January 2015.",

Two of the lawmen – Police Officers 1 Jeffrey Perez and Ricky Arquilita – allegedly killed Arnaiz in a shootout after he allegedly robbed taxi driver Tomas Bagcal along C-3 Road on Aug. 18. The IAS recommended that Perez and Arquilita’s superior, Maypajo police precinct commander Chief Inspector Fortunato Ecle, be demoted to a lower rank of senior inspector for grave neglect of duty. IAS inspector general Alfegar Triambulo said nine other police officers who raided the house of 51-year-old Gina Erobas during a supposed anti-drug operation are facing dismissal from the police service. CCTV footage showed the policemen ransacking the house of Erobas with the help of a minor on Sept. 7. “They were found liable for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming of police officers,” Triambulo said. He said Erobas originally tagged 13 policemen in the robbery. But four of them were cleared of the charges after they proved that they were not present during the incident. Tala police precinct commander Chief Inspector Timothy Aniway Jr. was suspended for 50 days for grave neglect of duty, according to Triambulo.  “Although Aniway was not directly involved in the illegal raid, he was included in the case for command responsibility,” the IAS chief said. In her complaint, Erobas said the police officers broke into her house and accused her of hiding shabu. Erobas said she lost at least P26,000 worth of cash and valuables during the break-in.",

The price ceiling is expected to “prevent undue increase...in prices during the rehabilitation (of Marawi),” Trade Secretary and NPCC chair Ramon Lopez said. “We will also put up depots in the areas to ensure availability of construction materials...directly from manufacturers,” Lopez said. A price freeze on basic necessities and prime commodities was automatically implemented in Mindanao when President Duterte declared martial law on May 23. The Department of Trade and Industry had rejected calls to extend the price freeze on basic goods in Mindanao until the end of the year, saying the NPCC had declared that prices and the supply situation in Mindanao are now stable. Duterte declared Marawi liberated from terrorists on Oct. 17 after militant leaders Omar Maute and Isnilon Hapilon were killed in military operations. Lopez had earlier urged local and foreign businessmen to prepare for ”numerous opportunities” in Marawi and other areas in Mindanao once the conflict is over. “A lot of activities will really kick off. There will be a lot of opportunities in construction. It will even have a spillover effect in nearby areas,” Lopez said.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Another petition was filed before the Supreme Court (SC) yesterday seeking to void the Land Transportation Office (LTO)’s allegedly anomalous P836-million project involving the procurement of driver’s license cards with five-year validity. Rep. Aniceto Bertiz III of the Acts Overseas Filipino Workers Coalition of Organizations party-list group asked the SC to stop the procurement of over eight million plastic license cards from NEXTIX, Dermalog Identification Systems and CFP Strategic Transaction Advisors joint venture. Last May, the Anti-Trapo Movement filed a petition before the high court to scrap the LTO project. Bertiz argued that the LTO could not proceed with the project because it did not have any allocation from the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Bertiz cited Article 6, Section 29 (1) of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that “no money should be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.” “In the absence of a specific item of appropriation for the production of driver’s licenses in the GAA 2016, Congress intended not to appropriate public funds for the procurement of license cards. The government did not allocate a single centavo for the project,” read the petition. Bertiz alleged that the project bidding was rigged for having “a dubious” variance of only P6.3 million or less than one percent from the winning bid.  He urged the SC to stop the implementation of the project, which includes the sale and conveyance of driver’s license cards as well as the collection of money from motor vehicle owners and disbursing public funds for the payment of suppliers. Named respondents were Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, National Treasurer Rosalia de Leon, Commission on Audit chairman Michael Aguinaldo and LTO chief Edgar Galvante.   Bertiz sought relief from the SC after the LTO awarded the procurement of 8,360,000 license cards to the joint venture, which placed a bid of P829,668,053.55. Two other contractors  –  Kolonwel and AT Pura joint venture and Banner Plasticard Inc. – offered lower bids of P814.32 million and P750 million, respectively.",

The crime laboratory also recovered five pieces of aluminum foil, with traces of shabu, from the crime scene but Oavenada refused to say whether he was among those who sniffed shabu. Cariño said Cama died of head injuries. Her underwear and shorts, as well as her cell phone, were recovered near her body.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) yesterday announced the suspension of routine labor inspections of all commercial establishments starting on Dec. 8. “Like in the past years, we are suspending routine inspections from Dec. 8 to Jan. 7 to avoid suspicions that our inspectors are just asking for holiday gifts,” Labor Undersecretary Joel Maglunsod said. Maglunsod said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello will issue the necessary administrative order directing all DOLE regional directors to suspend labor inspections in their areas of jurisdiction. But Maglunsod said inspections based on complaints for violations of labor standards and occupational safety and health rules are not covered by the suspension. He said companies engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of firecrackers are also not covered by the inspection moratorium. DOLE traditionally suspends routine labor inspections during the holiday season to prevent labor inspectors from abusing their authority to solicit gifts. Maglunsod said DOLE opted to delay for a few days the start of the inspection moratorium – usually set on Dec. 1 – to give regional offices more time to meet their target number of workers to be regularized. Each regional office has a target number of workers to be regularized in line with the DOLE’s campaign to end all illegal forms of contractualization by the end of the year. Since DOLE launched the campaign against illegal contractualization in 2016, over 75,000 workers have been regularized while 125,000 are in the process of regularization, Maglunsod said.",

            "content": "ZAMBOANGA CITY — A senior military commander wants Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to remain under the Martial Law. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., commander of Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom), said he wants to extend Martial Law in ARMM because of their assessment of the high level of acceptance of the people. Galvez said, aside from ARMM being part of the Westmincom area of responsibility (AOR), he wants to maintain the martial law in parts of Zamboanga and Iligan cities. “Based on what we see, though I don’t want to pre-judge, but for the Westmincom AOR it is safe for me to at least say that ARMM should be maintained under martial law and some other areas like part of Zamboanga and also area of Iligan,” Galvez said. He said there is an ongoing military campaign against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), another affiliate group of IS in Central Mindanao. Galvez also pointed to the recalibration of its campaign against the Abu Sayyaf group in Sulu and Basilan. Galvez, however, said the extension or the stay of Martial Law in Mindanao will still depend on the assessment based consultation with the people. The military official said Martial Law helped contained the situation in Marawi City following failed attempt of the pro-Islamic State (IS) Maute and Abu Sayyaf group to establish its caliphate. \"We're conducting the assessment... we have seen the great implication of martial law throughout Mindanao during the Marawi crisis. We see there is a strategic containment of the situation because of the martial law,\" Galvez said. \"The people are asking, they want martial law will continue because they see that due to martial law they will feel more safe,\" Galvez said. He said on the military and law enforcement side, the suspension of habeas corpus helped security forces to expedite lawful actions against the threat groups. \"Unlike the martial law during the early days, The martial law we have currently the full constitutional rights of our citizens is being protected. We have seen in Marawi even though we have the martial law the high level of acceptance of the military from the civilian populace. Not only in Marawi but also the whole populace (whole nation) that the military can be trusted in the implementation of martial law,\" Galvez added.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — The Sandiganbayan has affirmed the dismissal of criminal cases against Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian in connection with the alleged anomalous acquisition by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) of a thrift bank partially owned by his family. In a 30-page resolution promulgated on Nov. 17, released to the media yesterday, the court’s Special Fourth Division said “no new arguments or any good and cogent reason” was raised in the motion for reconsideration of the Office of the Ombudsman’s prosecution team to warrant the reversal of its Oct. 18, 2016 ruling dismissing the cases of graft, malversation of public funds and violation of the Manual of Regulation for Banks (MORB) against Gatchalian. In the same ruling, the Fourth Division also granted the motion for reconsideration of the other members of the Gatchalian family, namely Valenzuela Rep. Wesley, businessman Kenneth and their parents William and Dee Hua, praying for the dismissal of their graft case. The Valenzuela congressman said his family “is vindicated” and the “truth has finally prevailed. We have maintained from the very start that we are innocent of the accusations against us.” The court also ruled to dismiss the cases of graft, malversation and violation of the MORB against all the other accused except for former LWUA chairman and incumbent Surigao del Sur Rep. Prospero Pichay and former LWUA acting deputy administrator Wilfredo Feleo Jr. The court said it found probable cause to proceed with the trial of Pichay and Feleo, who face three counts each of graft and one count each of violation of the MORB. Aside from the Gatchalians, also acquitted were former LWUA officials Eduardo Bangayan and Aurelio Puentevella; Wellex Group Inc. corporate executive Yolanda dela Cruz; Forum Pacific Inc. (FPI) executives Elvira Ting, Peter Salud, Geronimo Velasco, Jr., Rogelio Garcia, Lamberto Mercado Jr., Evelyn dela Rosa, Arthur Ponsaran and Joaquin Obieta; Express Savings Bank Inc. (ESBI) executives George Chua, Gregorio Ipong, Generoso Tulagan, Wilfred Billena and Edita Bueno. The cases against former LWUA executives Enrique Montilla III and Daniel Landingin were also dismissed on the account of their death. Filed by the Office of the Ombudsman in July 2016, the cases stemmed from LWUA’s acquisition of ESBI, a local thrift bank based in Laguna owned by FPI and the Gatchalian family’s Wellex Group allegedly without the approval of the Office of the President, the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and the Department of Finance. The alleged anomalous acquisition was done in 2009 during Pichay’s term as LWUA chairman. Based on the information of the cases, LWUA bought a total of 445,377 shares of stock from ESBI for P80 million despite the bank’s insolvency status after suffering substantial net losses and capital deficits for five straight years, or from 2005 to 2009. The LWUA also allegedly deposited P700 million to ESBI’s savings account to augment the bank’s capital stocks, again without the required approval of the BSP’s Monetary Board. In its ruling, the court said the prosecution failed to show that the executives of ESBI conspired with the LWUA officials of the bank’s acquisition and the augmentation of its capital stocks. “It bears stressing that the accused ESBI directors assumed their positions only after the alleged illegal and unlawful acquisition of the shares by LWUA,” the court’s ruling read. The resolution was penned by Associate Justice Geraldine Faith Econg with the concurrence of Associate Justices Alex Quiroz, Reynaldo Cruz, Sarah Jane Fernandez and Edgardo Caldona. – Delon Porcalla, Marc Jayson Cayabyab",

Medina said the hostages were rescued following sustained search and rescue operations conducted by  personnel of the Joint Task Force Tawi-Tawi.  He said the task force intensified its efforts after the bandits threatened to execute one of the hostages.  “One of the victims was scheduled to be beheaded last Thursday,” he said. Medina said the Abu Sayyaf demanded P3 million for the release of the victims.  Task force commander Brig. Gen.

Minalang confirmed that they were separated from their captors when the soldiers pounded their position with cannons.

Senior Superintendent Orlando Yebra Jr., Pasig City police chief, admitted they have no witnesses but only scientific evidence on hand to help them solve the killing of Mabel Cama, 22. Yebra added that the reward money could greatly help them convince witnesses to surface after truck driver Randy Oavenada, 37, was arrested on Sunday. Earlier, Mayor Lourdes Briguerra of Paracale, Camarines Norte offered a P50,000 reward for the solution to the case. Cama’s father, Reynaldo, 53, works for her firm, Mega Bus Line. The remaining P250,000 was shelled out by Pasig Mayor Bobby Eusebio for information leading to the arrest of Oavenada’s companions, Director Oscar Albayalde, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief said during a press conference at the Eastern Police District (EPD) headquarters yesterday. The Pasig police yesterday filed rape with homicide charges against Oavenada before the city prosecutor’s office. With Oavenada now behind bars, EPD director Chief Superintendent Romulo Sapitula is confident that witnesses would surface, especially those interested in the reward money. “I grieve with you on the untimely death of your daughter. Today, we bring justice to her death while I commend the EPD for the speedy arrest of her assailant. We hope to bring peace and healing to you,” Albayalde told Cama’s father, who was in the same room. Oavenada was considered a witness but was officially arrested Sunday after latent prints lifted by the EPD crime laboratory on Cama’s cell phone matched his fingerprints. He also tested positive for shabu. Superintendent Isidro Cariño, head of the EPD’s crime laboratory, said they recovered five pieces of aluminum foil from the abandoned office where Cama’s body was found and two of them bore traces of metamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. Cariño said they lifted another fingerprint from Cama’s cell phone but it did not match those of the four other “persons of interest” in the case. Though Cama’s shorts and underwear were recovered near her body, Cariño explained that they are still trying to determine whether the victim was raped. The EPD chief said they are investigating reports that the abandoned office was used as a drug den. Sapitula said the investigation of Cama’s case is a continuing process until “all the suspects have been accounted for.” Cama’s father said the family was happy that Oavenada was arrested as it reduced the heavy burden on his family. The elder Cama expressed hope that the remaining suspects would decide to surrender.",

Mayor Joseph Estrada said with Christmas fast approaching, there has been an increasing number of vagrants, most of them Badjaos asking for alms, at Baywalk and public parks and promenade areas. Citing Presidential Decree 1563 or the Mendicancy Law of 1978, Estrada said the city government is only trying to ensure the safety and welfare of both the public and the mendicants from criminals and road hazards. He pointed out that the constant presence of uniformed law enforcers in the streets would serve as a deterrent to vagrants, illegal vendors and petty criminals such as robbers and snatchers taking advantage of the holiday season. Manila social welfare chief Nanette Tanyag said there have been recent incidents of foreigners and tourists strolling along Baywalk being harassed by beggars and street children asking for money. Some have lost valuable items such as mobile phones to snatchers and thieves, she added. Tanyag said at least 50 homeless persons have been roaming Roxas Boulevard alone, begging for alms. She said the law against mendicancy penalizes “habitual mendicants” with fines ranging from P500 to P1,000 or a prison term of two years to four years.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — One of the five alleged members of the “Termite Gang,” who stole more than P7 million from a Chinabank branch in Quezon City, was arrested anew yesterday in connection with a robbery at a hardware store in Cavite earlier this year.  Alyson Aligan, 23, was arrested by police at around 3:40 p.m. at the Quezon City Hall compound during the implementation of an arrest warrant against him just as he attended a pre-trial conference on charges of illegal possession of firearms linked to the bank robbery. Also included in the arrest warrant were Aligan’s co-accused in the bank robbery, Gerald Bawas and Jordan Agustin Duldulao, as well as a certain Medhi Kobb. Judge Dennis Pastrana of the Regional Trial Court Branch 90 in Dasmariñas issued the arrest warrant, no bail recommended, against the four respondents tagged in the robbery at a Wilcon Hardware branch in Dasmariñas, Cavite last May. They were supposedly able to take around P1 million and documents from the safety vault by destroying the fire exits of the establishment.  Aligan, Bawas, and two of their alleged cohorts were just released from detention this month after posting bail of P12,000 each for the bank robbery. He and Bawas also posted P120,000 bail each for illegal possession of firearms. Duldulao remains in jail as the charge of illegal possession of explosives filed against him by police is non-bailable. Aligan, Duldulao and Bawas admitted that they served as lookouts during the heist, wherein they were able to destroy the main bank vault and more than 40 safety deposit boxes and stole P7.6 million in cash and valuables. Police said the suspects managed to enter the bank at the corner of Camaro street and Commonwealth Avenue in Barangay Greater Fairview by digging a tunnel from the drainage canals outside the bank.",

            "content": "MANILA, Philippines — At least 585 motorists were identified yesterday as violators of the yellow lane policy and other traffic rules. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority yesterday said through its no-contact and manual apprehension, 364 private vehicle drivers and 114 bus drivers were recorded to have committed traffic violations. Under the MMDA’s yellow lane only policy, private motorists who will violate it will be fined P500 while buses will be fined P200 for the manual apprehension. Garcia said the yellow lane was revived by MMDA Chairman Danilo Lim to see if it is effective in solving the traffic gridlock on EDSA. The policy aims to segregate public utility vehicles from private buses to decongest busy lanes in the metropolis. “For the first time ever, private vehicles ran 40 to 60 kilometers per hour (kph) during Monday morning’s rush hour on EDSA,” MMDA assistant general manager for planning Jojo Garcia said in a press conference yesterday. Garcia and Lim monitored the traffic situation in the metropolis yesterday at the MMDA’s Metrobase in Makati City following the revival of the yellow lane policy. The MMDA is also set to crack down on motorcycle riders who will go out of the blue lane or the lane dedicated to two-wheeled vehicles on EDSA.",

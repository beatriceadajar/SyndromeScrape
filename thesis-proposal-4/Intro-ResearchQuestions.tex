This study seeks to determine how web scraping local news sites of syndromic data can augment FASSSTER, a syndromic surveillance initiative in the Philippines, in the early detection of diseases.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What methods of web scraping would allow for retrieving relevant syndromic data from local news websites and utilizing this information for syndromic surveillance?
\item Is the volume of news articles generated by local news sites sufficient enough to be used for syndromic surveillance?
\item How does web scraping syndromic data from local news sites augment FASSSTER in terms of relevance and reliability of data? 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significance of the Study}

The study utilizes computer science concepts such as web scraping, support vector machines, latent Dirichlet allocation, relational databases, and system integration. Local news sites will be web scraped to retrieve news articles. These articles will then be subjected to support vector clustering to separate those that contain syndromic data from those that do not, then be further subjected to topic modeling through latent Dirichlet allocation. Information from this will then be stored in a relational database, and shall then be integrated into FASSSTER, an existing syndromic surveillance system.

This study could contribute to the improvement of syndromic surveillance systems employed in the Philippines. News sites generate relevant and crucial data that relate to health events, and this study aims to make use of this data for the earlier detection of diseases. This proposed system has the potential to give way to better syndromic surveillance efforts in the country.

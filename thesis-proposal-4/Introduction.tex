\chapter{Introduction}

In compliance with the 2005 revisions of the International Health Regulation (IHR), countries were required to report disease outbreaks of international level to the World Health Organization (WHO) within 24 hours \cite{worldtechnical}. As such, many countries have employed disease surveillance techniques so that outbreak cases could be reported to the respective bodies as soon as possible \cite{hartley2010landscape}.

Many traditional disease surveillance systems have relied chiefly on data generated by various health care workers from private health institutions and the public health system \cite{rohart2016disease}. However, some systems from other countries have been shown to take weeks to properly confirm cases of disease before resolving to an appropriate response \cite{rohart2016disease}, showing a possible problem with timeliness.

Various public health systems have turned towards syndromic surveillance, where signs and symptoms are used to detect disease before confirming diagnoses \cite{mandl2004implementing}, making it a useful tool in the early detection and monitoring of disease outbreaks.

Syndromic surveillance systems use data from electronically available sources such as electronic medical records \cite{lazarus2001using}, but also utilize unstructured sources such as infodemiological (health-related) tweets \cite{espina2016towards}. Moreover, global surveillance systems such as GPHIN, EpiSPIDER, and HealthMap that utilize articles from news sites have also been shown to be effective in generating event-based outbreak information \cite{keller2009use}. Sources such as these provide current and localized information about outbreaks, even from areas that are relatively unnoticed by traditional public health efforts \cite{woodall1997official}.

As such, this study proposes to augment an existing syndromic surveillance effort in the Philippines called FASSSTER through web scraping local news sites for syndromic data. This would allow data readily created by news providers in the Philippines to be used in the early detection of diseases.

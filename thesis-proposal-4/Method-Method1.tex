\section{Web Scraping News Sites}
The articles will come from mainstream news sites such as GMA News, ABS-CBN News, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, The Philippine Star, Manila Bulletin, and Rappler. These news sites were chosen from the list top Philippine sites generated by Amazon's Alexa. Alexa calculates the top sites globally, by country, or by category, based on daily time on site, daily page views per visitor, percentage of traffic from search, and the total number of sites linking in \cite{alexa}.

Web scraping can be done using a Python framework known as Scrapy. Scrapy is an open-source framework used for extracting data from various web sources. It has multiple components such as a spider engine, which handles the data flow and triggers actions depending on events, spiders, which handle the extraction and parsing of data, and the item pipeline, which then processes the data from the spiders \cite{nisafani2017eliciting}.

Scrapy will be used to pull the articles from the web pages of the given local news sites. These articles will then be classified appropriately using Support Vector Machines and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

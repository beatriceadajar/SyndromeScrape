\section{Latent Dirchlet Allocation}
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic framework for modeling and classifying collections of discrete data. Topics are represented as a multinomial variable, with each word in a given document allocated to a specific topic. To classify new documents, the probability of each document belonging to a specific topic is calculated using the model generate during the allocation of words to topics \cite{blei2002latent}.

LDA will be used for modeling topics under health and subsequently classifying the health-related articles into specific topics. The resulting percentages from the LDA will also determine the relevance of the article (i.e., if the article in question is really about health or barely) and reliability (i.e., what percentage of the article actually falls under the topic it was classified under). These classified articles will be sent to the database for integration to FASSSTER.

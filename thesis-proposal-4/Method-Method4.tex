\section{Integration into FASSSTER}
Because FASSSTER's objective is to create a data hub from various health-related sources, web scraping is a viable option as an additional source.

The Spatio-temporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM) within FASSSTER uses a compartmental disease model that incorporates several sources of syndromic information as coefficients in the differential equations used to model the spread of disease.

Information extracted as a result of web scraping will be stored in a relational database, MongoDB. Afterwards, this information will be directly incorporated as a coeffecient in the differential equation modeler of FASSSTER.
